title: One-Click Deployment
description: >-
  Deploy your fully designed backend to staging or production with a single
  action, monitor build progress, access live APIs, and track deployment
  history.

## **One-Click Deployment**

After your infrastructure is ready and microservices are designed, Mindbricks allows you to **deploy your entire backend to the cloud with a single click**.

This step turns your designed system into a **live, accessible backend**, complete with URLs, logs, and runtime monitoring.

---

## **Deployment Environments**

<Image src="https://blob-cdn.documentation.ai/org-39f2f004-5620-4ad2-9ba7-4e591d7735f7/doc-49f7ea0f-3aad-4d21-b3bf-699b5905ffea/1766049270578-vx48qtpb16i-pasted-image-1766049268762.png?q=85&fm=auto&auto=compress%2Cformat" width="1404" height="970" alt="" />

The main Deployment page shows the available **deployment environments** for your project.

By default, Mindbricks provides:

- **Staging** – for testing, QA, and validation

- **Production** – for live users and real traffic

Each environment displays:

- Current deployed version

- Deployment status (Passive, In Progress, Success)

- Public service URLs (once deployed)

- A **Deploy** button

Each environment is deployed **independently**, allowing controlled rollouts.

---

## **Deploying to an Environment**

When you select an environment (for example **Stage**), you enter the environment-specific deployment view.

### **Selecting an Instance**

<Image src="https://blob-cdn.documentation.ai/org-39f2f004-5620-4ad2-9ba7-4e591d7735f7/doc-49f7ea0f-3aad-4d21-b3bf-699b5905ffea/1766049371528-8p9tdo7rjx9-pasted-image-1766049370170.png?q=85&fm=auto&auto=compress%2Cformat" width="1464" height="711" alt="" />

Before deployment begins, you must select the **cloud server instance** where the services will run.

- Choose an instance from the dropdown

- The instance must already exist in **Cloud Servers**

- All services in this environment will run on that instance

---

## **Deploying Services**

<Image src="https://blob-cdn.documentation.ai/org-39f2f004-5620-4ad2-9ba7-4e591d7735f7/doc-49f7ea0f-3aad-4d21-b3bf-699b5905ffea/1766049406949-7g2vq16atd6-pasted-image-1766049405033.png?q=85&fm=auto&auto=compress%2Cformat" width="1506" height="974" alt="" />

Once an instance is selected, all project services are listed.

For each service, you can see:

- Service name

- Current deployed version

- Public service URL (if already deployed)

- Deployment status

- Last deployment timestamp

Clicking **Deploy** triggers deployment **only for that service**, allowing:

- Incremental rollouts

- Partial updates

- Safe version upgrades

When a service’s code changes, its **version is automatically incremented** and reflected here.

---

## **Live Deployment Logs**

<Image src="https://blob-cdn.documentation.ai/org-39f2f004-5620-4ad2-9ba7-4e591d7735f7/doc-49f7ea0f-3aad-4d21-b3bf-699b5905ffea/1766049473531-lw696cbjy7h-pasted-image-1766049471763.png?q=85&fm=auto&auto=compress%2Cformat" width="1404" height="975" alt="" />

During deployment, Mindbricks shows **real-time logs** for each service.

These logs indicate:

- Build start and completion

- Queue and execution status

- Deployment progress

- Success or failure events

Once deployment completes successfully, the service status switches to **Success**, confirming it is live.

---

## **Live API Interface (Post-Deployment)**

<Image src="https://blob-cdn.documentation.ai/org-39f2f004-5620-4ad2-9ba7-4e591d7735f7/doc-49f7ea0f-3aad-4d21-b3bf-699b5905ffea/1766049540295-vhlwgzc0zen-pasted-image-1766049538479.png?q=85&fm=auto&auto=compress%2Cformat" width="1919" height="979" alt="" />

After deployment, each service exposes a **live API interface**.

This interface is identical to the Preview API Interface described earlier, with two key differences:

- **No time limit** – the API remains available as long as the server is running.
- **Preview Tools are disabled** – the floating preview actions menu is not available in the live API interface.

From here, you can:

- Test live endpoints

- Inspect real responses

- Validate authentication and permissions

- Connect frontend applications

---

## **Deployment History**

<Image src="https://blob-cdn.documentation.ai/org-39f2f004-5620-4ad2-9ba7-4e591d7735f7/doc-49f7ea0f-3aad-4d21-b3bf-699b5905ffea/1766049599248-r088dvbd2g8-pasted-image-1766049597852.png?q=85&fm=auto&auto=compress%2Cformat" width="1452" height="975" alt="" />

The **Deploy History** page keeps a full record of all deployment activity.

For each deployment, you can see:

- Service name

- Deployed version

- Environment

- Build duration

- Deployment duration

- Final status (Success / Failed)

This gives you traceability and confidence when managing releases.

---

## **Using Deployed APIs in Your Application**

Once deployment is successful:

- Each service receives a **public subdomain**

- APIs are accessible from anywhere

- You can connect:

  - Web frontends

  - Mobile apps

  - External systems

  - Third-party integrations

At this point, your project is a **fully operational backend**.

---

## **What One-Click Deployment Gives You**

- No manual DevOps setup

- No CI/CD configuration required

- Automatic builds and versioning

- Live logs and history

- Stable, persistent APIs

- Production-ready infrastructure

This completes the journey from **design → preview → deployment**, all inside Mindbricks.
