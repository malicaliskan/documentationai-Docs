## **SearchObjectAction**

**Purpose**  
Run a keyword search against an object’s Elasticsearch index and return matching IDs as an array for further filtering.

**When to use it**

- You need a keyword search and then use the ID list in a follow-up query (`whereClause` of the main API).
- Lightweight search before fetching full objects or stats.

**Key fields**

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `targetObject` | DataObjectName | Object to search (current or foreign service). |
| `keyword` | MScript | Keyword expression to search for. |
| `searchProperties` | \[PropRefer] | Fields to search within the index. |

**Example**

```json
{
  "id": "a330-search-projects",
  "name": "searchProjects",
  "contextPropertyName": "matchingProjectIds",
  "targetObject": "Project",
  "keyword": "this.query.keyword",
  "searchProperties": ["name", "description", "ownerName"]
}
```
