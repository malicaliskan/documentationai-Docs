## Ontology Engine Overview

The Ontology Engine is Mindbricks' intelligent data management system that creates and maintains complex data relationships, schemas, and ontologies. It uses advanced graph theory and semantic analysis to understand your domain model.

## Core Functionality

The Ontology Engine provides several key capabilities:

  <Tab title="Data Modeling" icon="layers">
    Create comprehensive data models that capture your business domain accurately.
    
    <CodeGroup tabs="SQL,GraphQL">
      ```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE posts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  title VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
  content TEXT,
  published_at TIMESTAMP
);
```
      ```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  email: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
  createdAt: DateTime!
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String
  author: User!
  publishedAt: DateTime
}
```

## Ontology Types

The engine can handle various ontology patterns:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Entity-Relationship" icon="users">
    Traditional relational models with entities and relationships.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Graph-Based" icon="share-2">
    Complex graph structures for interconnected data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document-Oriented" icon="file-text">
    Flexible document schemas for varying data structures.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Schema Generation Process

The Ontology Engine follows a systematic approach:

1. **Analysis**: Parse input descriptions to identify entities and relationships
2. **Modeling**: Create initial ontology graph
3. **Optimization**: Apply normalization and performance optimizations
4. **Generation**: Produce database schema and migration scripts
5. **Validation**: Ensure schema integrity and consistency

<Expandable title="Advanced Ontology Features" default-open="false">
  For complex domains, the Ontology Engine can handle inheritance hierarchies, polymorphic relationships, and multi-tenant architectures.
</Expandable>

## Migration Management

Safe schema evolution is critical for production applications:

- Automatic migration script generation
- Rollback capabilities for failed migrations
- Data transformation during schema changes
- Zero-downtime migration support

<Callout kind="tip">Always test migrations on staging environments before applying to production.</Callout>

## Integration with AI Architect

The Ontology Engine works seamlessly with the AI Architect:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Automatic Schema | Generate schemas from AI Architect specifications |
| Relationship Inference | Understand implied relationships in requirements |
| Schema Refinement | Iteratively improve schemas based on feedback |
| Consistency Checking | Ensure schema matches API expectations |

## Performance Optimization

The Ontology Engine optimizes schemas for:

- Query performance with appropriate indexing
- Data normalization and denormalization strategies
- Caching layer integration
- Read/write optimization based on access patterns

## Best Practices

To maximize Ontology Engine effectiveness:

1. Provide comprehensive domain descriptions
2. Include relationship cardinalities and constraints
3. Specify performance requirements upfront
4. Review generated schemas for business logic accuracy
5. Plan for future schema evolution
