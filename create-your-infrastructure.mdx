title: Create Your Infrastructure
description: >-
  Set up and manage cloud servers that provide the persistent runtime
  environment required to deploy your application to staging or production.
---
## **Create Your Infrastructure**

After previewing your application, the next step is to create **persistent infrastructure** where your services will run for staging or production.

Preview environments are temporary and automatically shut down.\
To deploy your application for real users, you must create **Cloud Servers**.

Cloud servers act as the **runtime foundation** for deployments.

---

## **Cloud Servers Overview**

Cloud servers provide:

- Compute resources (CPU, memory, storage)

- Auto-scalable worker groups

- Persistent runtime environments

- Monitoring, metrics, and logs

- Cost control via usage alerts

Each cloud server belongs to a **workspace** and can host multiple projects and services.

The Instances page shows available **server worker groups** that you can purchase and deploy.

Each worker group represents a predefined server configuration.

This page lists available **worker group types** with their specifications and pricing.

### **Worker Group Details**

Each worker group displays:

- **Price** (hourly billing)

- **CPU** cores

- **Memory (RAM)**

- **Storage**

- **Buy Instance** action

Example (Small Node Group):

- **Price:** $0.25 / hour

- **CPU:** 2 cores

- **Memory:** 8 GB

- **Storage:** 30 GB

Use this page to choose the server capacity that fits your workload.

<Image src="https://blob-cdn.documentation.ai/org-39f2f004-5620-4ad2-9ba7-4e591d7735f7/doc-49f7ea0f-3aad-4d21-b3bf-699b5905ffea/1765894465361-n1z1tihexbb-pasted-image-1765894464365.png?q=85&fm=auto&auto=compress%2Cformat" width="1919" height="979" alt="" />

After clicking **Buy Instance**, a configuration modal opens where you define how the server will run.

### **Configuration Fields**

**Server Name**\
A unique name to identify this cloud server inside the workspace.

**Min Instance Count**\
The minimum number of instances that must always be running.

**Max Instance Count**\
The maximum number of instances allowed to scale up to.

**Desired Instance Count**\
The initial number of instances to start.\
Must be between the minimum and maximum values.

### **Example**

- Min Instances: `2`

- Max Instances: `10`

- Desired Instances: `2`

This setup ensures baseline availability while allowing future scaling.

## **Cloud Servers → Payment & Setup**

<Image src="https://blob-cdn.documentation.ai/org-39f2f004-5620-4ad2-9ba7-4e591d7735f7/doc-49f7ea0f-3aad-4d21-b3bf-699b5905ffea/1765808135112-pbv6ecvih1-pasted-image-1765808133294.png?q=85&fm=auto&auto=compress%2Cformat" width="1919" height="928" alt="" />

When creating a new cloud server for the first time, a **one-time server setup fee** is required.

### **Server Setup Fee**

- Covers **initial server provisioning and configuration**

- Charged **once per server**

- Shown clearly before payment confirmation

### **Payment Options**

- Secure card payment

- Payment link (if supported)

After successful payment, the server creation process begins automatically.

---

## **Cloud Servers → Payment Successful**

<Image src="https://blob-cdn.documentation.ai/org-39f2f004-5620-4ad2-9ba7-4e591d7735f7/doc-49f7ea0f-3aad-4d21-b3bf-699b5905ffea/1765894750836-fs27nu96sn-pasted-image-1765894749946.png?q=85&fm=auto&auto=compress%2Cformat" width="706" height="771" alt="" />

Once the payment is completed, a confirmation modal is shown.

**What this means**

- Your cloud server has been successfully created

- The server enters an initial **Pending** state

- Provisioning and setup start in the background

The confirmation view displays:

- Server name

- Instance type (worker group)

- Hourly price

- Min / Max instance counts

- Current status

## **Cloud Servers → Instance Details**

<Image src="https://blob-cdn.documentation.ai/org-39f2f004-5620-4ad2-9ba7-4e591d7735f7/doc-49f7ea0f-3aad-4d21-b3bf-699b5905ffea/1765894961472-kmt3gdfv4dg-pasted-image-1765894959033.png?q=85&fm=auto&auto=compress%2Cformat" width="1918" height="973" alt="" />

After creation, each cloud server has its own **instance detail page**.

This page allows you to **monitor, scale, and manage** the server.

### **Instance Information**

- Server name and status (Pending / Active)

- Worker group type

- Hourly price

- CPU

- Memory

- Storage

---

## **Scaling the Worker Group**

The **Scale Worker Group** section allows you to control how many instances are running.

**Controls**

- **Min** – minimum number of instances that must always stay active

- **Desired** – currently running instance count

- **Max** – maximum number of instances allowed

You can adjust scaling using the slider within the allowed range.

Changes take effect dynamically and respect the configured limits.

---

## **Budget & Usage Alerts**

The **Worker Group Budget Alert** section helps you control monthly costs.

**You can configure**

- Monthly usage alert thresholds

- Budget limit warnings

- Visual indicators as usage approaches limits

These alerts help prevent unexpected costs.

---

## **Instance Metrics & Monitoring**

Each cloud server provides **real-time metrics** for performance and usage monitoring.

Available metrics include:

- **CPU usage (%)**

- **Memory usage (%)**

- **Network in / out**

- **Instance-level activity**

These metrics help you understand load, performance, and scaling needs.

---

## **Deployed Projects & Services**

If any projects are deployed to this cloud server, the instance view also shows:

- Which **projects** are running on the server

- Which **services** are deployed per project

- Runtime status of deployed services

This provides clear visibility into **what is running where**.

---

## **Instance Actions**

From the instance detail page, you can:

- Scale instance count

- Monitor usage and metrics

- View deployed projects and services

- Terminate the instance when no longer needed

> ⚠️ Terminating an instance will stop all workloads running on that server.

## **Infrastructure and Deployment Connection**

Cloud servers are used directly during deployment:

1. You choose a deployment environment (Stage or Production)

2. You select an existing cloud server

3. Services are deployed onto that server

4. Traffic is routed to the deployed services

Without an active cloud server, deployment cannot proceed.
