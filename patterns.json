  /*
   * Mindbricks Pattern Definition Scheme
   *
   * This JSON document serves as the foundational ontology for the Mindbricks platform—a code generation and deployment system designed to build microservice-based application architectures.
   *
   * Each object in this document defines a "pattern class", which is a schema blueprint describing reusable architectural elements. Pattern classes may contain primitive types or reference other pattern classes, allowing for deeply composable and nested designs.
   *
   * A complete application in Mindbricks is constructed by combining these pattern classes into a "Mindbricks Project"—an overarching structure that encompasses services, authentication modules, BFF layers, shared libraries, and infrastructure configurations.
   *
   * These patterns are used by both AI agents and human architects. While AI agents interpret these patterns for automated generation and reasoning, human users interact with them via visual design interfaces within the Mindbricks Studio.
   *
   * Once authored, a Mindbricks Project is represented as a JSON structure conforming to this pattern ontology. That JSON serves as the single source of truth for generating application code, documentation, and deployment assets.
   *
   * For maintainers: Ensure any additions or changes to this file follow the structural conventions and documentation standards, as these entries are rendered in the platform's UI for end-user guidance and also parsed by AI agents.

It sits at the top of the Mindbricks ontology tree—a structured, semantic pattern definition scheme used to model projects. Mindbricks leverages this ontology to generate microservice-based applications by interpreting and compiling interconnected pattern objects. Each pattern object is defined as a class with typed properties, which can include both primitive types and references to other pattern classes. Projects are built as JSON instances that follow this schema, enabling AI agents and human architects to collaboratively define a system's structure, behavior, and deployment blueprint in a unified and machine-readable format.",

A common use case is transferring tenant or client identifiers from a parent object into a child record. For example, when creating an email job for a specific user, the system can use the userId to join the User object, fetch its clientId, and statically assign it to the EmailJob object. This makes it easy to query email jobs by clientId without needing to join back to the User table at runtime. Note that, all static joins are executed before the property formula executions and the fetched data and read property (field) is written to the context like `this.product` and `this.amount`, so you can use these context data with in the calculated properties for either the same joint property or for another property.",
