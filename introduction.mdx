## Core Features

Mindbricks offers three interconnected components that work together to accelerate backend development:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AI Architect" icon="brain">
    The AI architect analyzes your requirements and generates complete backend structures, including APIs, databases, and business logic. It uses machine learning to optimize for performance and scalability.
    
    <Callout kind="info">The AI architect can generate backends in under 5 minutes from natural language descriptions.</Callout>
    
    <CodeGroup tabs="Python,Node.js">
      ```python
import mindbricks

# Generate a user management backend
backend = mindbricks.generate_backend({
    "type": "user_management",
    "features": ["auth", "profile", "permissions"],
    "database": "postgresql"
})
```
      ```javascript
const mindbricks = require('mindbricks');

// Generate API with authentication
mindbricks.generate({
    type: 'api',
    endpoints: ['users', 'posts'],
    auth: 'jwt'
});
```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Ontology Engine" icon="database">
    The ontology engine manages complex data relationships and provides intelligent schema generation. It automatically creates database schemas, migrations, and relationships based on your domain model.
    
    <Expandable title="How Ontology Processing Works" default-open="false">
      The engine uses graph theory and semantic analysis to understand data relationships, generating optimized database structures that evolve with your application needs.
    </Expandable>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cloud Infrastructure" icon="cloud">
    Deploy your generated backends instantly to cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure. Mindbricks provides auto-scaling, monitoring, and security out of the box.
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Connect Cloud Account" icon="cloud">
        Link your cloud provider account through the Mindbricks dashboard.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Generate Backend" icon="code">
        Use the AI architect to create your backend specification.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Deploy" icon="rocket">
        Click deploy and watch your backend go live in minutes.
      </Step>

## Use Cases

Mindbricks serves various development scenarios:

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Generate functional backends in minutes for proof-of-concepts
- **Startup MVPs**: Build scalable foundations without extensive development teams
- **Enterprise Applications**: Create complex, secure backends with AI assistance
- **API Development**: Automatically generate REST and GraphQL APIs with documentation

The platform supports multiple programming languages and database systems, making it adaptable to different technology stacks and team preferences.

## Getting Started

To begin using Mindbricks:

1. Create an account on the Mindbricks platform
2. Describe your backend requirements in natural language
3. Let the AI architect generate your initial structure
4. Customize and refine using the ontology engine
5. Deploy to your preferred cloud infrastructure

Mindbricks handles the heavy lifting of backend architecture, allowing developers to focus on business logic and user experience.
