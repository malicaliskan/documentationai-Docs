## **Create Your Infrastructure**

After previewing your application, the next step is to create **persistent infrastructure** where your services will run for staging or production.

Preview environments are temporary and automatically shut down.\
To deploy your application for real users, you must create **Cloud Servers**.

Cloud servers act as the **runtime foundation** for deployments.

---

## **Cloud Servers Overview**

Cloud servers provide:

- Compute resources (CPU, memory, storage)

- Auto-scalable worker groups

- Persistent runtime environments

- Monitoring, metrics, and logs

- Cost control via usage alerts

Each cloud server belongs to a **workspace** and can host multiple projects and services.

## **Viewing Available Instances**

The **Instances** page displays all available worker group configurations.

Each worker group represents a predefined server type with:

- CPU core count

- Memory (RAM)

- Disk storage

- Hourly pricing

You can review and compare configurations before creating a server.

---

## **Buying an Instance**

<Image src="https://blob-cdn.documentation.ai/org-39f2f004-5620-4ad2-9ba7-4e591d7735f7/doc-49f7ea0f-3aad-4d21-b3bf-699b5905ffea/1765980834785-t9pgn69kwqf-pasted-image-1765980834879.png?q=85&fm=auto&auto=compress%2Cformat" width="1919" height="974" alt="" />

When you click **Buy Instance**, you choose the worker group that best fits your workload.

Each option shows:

- **Price** (billed hourly)

- **CPU**

- **Memory**

- **Storage**

This allows you to balance performance and cost based on expected traffic and usage.

## **Creating a Cloud Server**

<Image src="https://blob-cdn.documentation.ai/org-39f2f004-5620-4ad2-9ba7-4e591d7735f7/doc-49f7ea0f-3aad-4d21-b3bf-699b5905ffea/1765980909076-9rukejrqfpn-pasted-image-1765980909428.png?q=85&fm=auto&auto=compress%2Cformat" width="1919" height="983" alt="" />

After selecting a worker group, you configure how the server will run.

### **Configuration Fields**

**Server Name**\
A unique identifier for the server inside the workspace.

**Min Instance Count**\
The minimum number of instances that must always stay running.

**Max Instance Count**\
The maximum number of instances the server can scale up to.

**Desired Instance Count**\
The number of instances to start immediately.

These values define the **scaling behavior** of the server.

---

### **Example Configuration**

- Min Instances: `2`

- Max Instances: `10`

- Desired Instances: `2`

This ensures baseline availability while allowing automatic scaling when load increases.

---

## **Payment & Setup**

When creating a cloud server for the first time, a **one-time setup fee** is required.

This fee covers:

- Initial provisioning

- Infrastructure configuration

- Runtime preparation

After payment is completed, the server setup begins automatically.

---

## **Server Provisioning Status**

Once payment is successful:

- The server enters a **Pending** state

- Infrastructure provisioning runs in the background

- Status updates appear in the interface

When provisioning completes, the server becomes **Active** and ready for deployments.

---

## **Managing Cloud Server Details**

<Image src="https://blob-cdn.documentation.ai/org-39f2f004-5620-4ad2-9ba7-4e591d7735f7/doc-49f7ea0f-3aad-4d21-b3bf-699b5905ffea/1765981175544-llu2u0auzj-pasted-image-1765981175383.png?q=85&fm=auto&auto=compress%2Cformat" width="1919" height="975" alt="" />

Each cloud server has a dedicated **Instance Details** page.

Here you can view:

- Server status (Pending / Active)

- Worker group type

- Hourly pricing

- CPU, memory, and storage information

---

## **Scaling the Server**

The **Scale Worker Group** section allows you to adjust capacity at any time.

You can change:

- Minimum instance count

- Desired instance count

- Maximum instance count

Scaling changes apply dynamically and control how the server responds to traffic and workload changes.

---

## **Budget & Usage Alerts**

Cloud servers include **budget and usage monitoring**.

You can configure:

- Monthly usage alert thresholds

- Budget warnings

- Visual indicators as usage approaches limits

These tools help prevent unexpected infrastructure costs.

---

## **Metrics & Monitoring**

Each cloud server provides real-time metrics, including:

- CPU usage percentage

- Memory usage percentage

- Network traffic (in / out)

- Instance-level activity

These metrics help you understand performance and scaling needs before and after deployment.

---

## **Deployed Projects & Services**

When services are deployed to a cloud server, you can see:

- Which projects are running on the server

- Which services belong to each project

- Runtime status of deployed services

This gives clear visibility into **what is running where**.

---

## **Infrastructure and Deployment Connection**

Cloud servers are used directly during deployment:

1. You choose a deployment environment (Stage or Production)

2. You select an existing cloud server

3. Services are deployed onto that server

4. Traffic is routed to the deployed services

Without an active cloud server, deployment cannot proceed.
