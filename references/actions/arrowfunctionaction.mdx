title: ArrowFunctionAction
---
## **ArrowFunctionAction**

**Purpose**  
Define a reusable arrow function at runtime and store it on the API context (`this.<contextPropertyName>`). Other MScript snippets can call it to avoid repeating logic.

**When to use it**

- You need to reuse the same computation across multiple actions in the workflow.
- You want to keep map/filter/reduce code readable by defining helpers upfront.

**Key fields**

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `parameterNames` | \[String] | Names of the function parameters (used inside `functionBody`). |
| `functionBody` | Text | JavaScript body of the arrow function (wrap in `{ ... }`). |

**Example**

```json
{
  "id": "a310-tax-fn",
  "name": "setTaxCalculator",
  "contextPropertyName": "calcPriceWithVat",
  "parameterNames": ["price"],
  "functionBody": "{ const vat = 0.18; return price * (1 + vat); }"
}
```

Later actions can call `this.calcPriceWithVat(100)` inside their MScript expressions.
