**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines the overall structure and configuration for a microservice within the project. Each service acts as an independent domain that encapsulates its own data model, business logic, and interface behaviors. While services primarily manage and expose domain-specific data, this module extends beyond basic CRUD operations by offering customizable patterns, libraries, authentication, and specialized route handling. Use this module to tailor the internal and external behaviors of your service—whether it's securing endpoints, defining edge routes, managing complex data objects, or integrating advanced logic. The service configuration ensures the resulting microservice is robust, secure, and aligned with the specific application requirements.

```typescript
interface Service = {
  serviceSettings : ServiceSettings;
  dataObjects : DataObject[];
  businessLogic : BusinessApi[];
  library : ServiceLibrary;
  edgeControllers : EdgeController[];
}
```

| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| serviceSettings | The general configuration for the service, including its basic metadata and authentication rules. This sets foundational behavior such as login requirements and token usage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| dataObjects     | An array of data object definitions representing the internal data schema of the service. Each object defines its fields, relations, and business logic behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| businessLogic   | BusinessApi enables the creation of sophisticated backend operations through declarative configuration. It should be used when a project needs to expose business logic as APIs - whether through REST endpoints, real-time WebSocket connections, event-driven Kafka handlers, or scheduled cron jobs. BusinessApi automatically handles CRUD operations on data objects, parameter extraction from multiple sources (request body, Redis, session), authentication, and complex workflows with validation, transformations, and inter-service calls. Use BusinessApi when you need to create, read, update, or delete data, process events, schedule background tasks, or orchestrate multi-step business operations without writing custom backend code. |
| library         | The service's function library where custom business logic is written. Includes edge functions, and shared utilities callable across routes and controllers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| edgeControllers | A set of custom controller endpoints defined at the edge of the service, each connected to a function from the service library. Edge controllers offer custom REST APIs beyond the auto-generated business APIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
