# MindbricksProject

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

MindbricksProject is the root class representing the entire architecture of a software project in Mindbricks. It sits at the top of the Mindbricks ontology tree—a structured, semantic pattern definition scheme used to model projects. Mindbricks leverages this ontology to generate microservice-based applications by interpreting and compiling interconnected pattern objects. Each pattern object is defined as a class with typed properties, which can include both primitive types and references to other pattern classes. Projects are built as JSON instances that follow this schema, enabling AI agents and human architects to collaboratively define a system's structure, behavior, and deployment blueprint in a unified and machine-readable format.

```typescript
interface MindbricksProject = {
  projectSettings : ProjectSettings;
  authentication : ProjectAuthentication;
  bffService : BFFService;
  notificationService : NotificationService;
  services : Service[];
}
```

| frontendDocument              | A text based information to inform the frontend developer or frontend AI agent about the general UX behaviour of the application based on user stories and use cases. The format may be either text or markdown(recommended). Write the document as an AI prompt and describe application gneric UX behaviours. Any service or data object specific information should be given as a brief key sentence, since they will be detailed in their own objects. Note that this document will be given to the AI agent or human developer combined with all technical details that is generated from the project design,so this document should only focus on application-global behavioral UX business logic. |
| hasAuthentication             | Determines if the project uses an authentication system (for users, administrators, etc.). Enabling this typically activates an auth microservice and related security features. Detailed settings are in the main authentication module.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ignoreDeploymentSpecificFiles | Use this in your custom deployment not to generate auto-deployemnt specific files so you can integrate your own files to your repository. AI Agents should keep this false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| rolesObject            | Defines the list of roles available in the project. Each role is represented as a RoleItem object with a name and a value. These roles will be used to assign permissions and will appear in session data during authentication. Note that for single tenant applications, superAdmin, admin , user roles and for multi-tenant applications superAdmin, saasAdmin, tenantOwner, tenantAdmin, tenantUser roles are default system roles. And thery are active even RBAC is not active.Any role item in this rolesObject will be addtional role to these system roles. |
| customRoleLookups      | An optional mapping of custom logical roles and their evaluation logic. Each entry maps a role name to an MScript condition that determines whether the role is assigned to a user dynamically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| usersHaveMultipleRoles | Indicates whether users can have multiple roles. If true, the `roleId` in the session and user model will be treated as an array of role values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

#### RoleItem

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Represents a role definition in the RBAC system. Each role includes a `name` for display and a `value` used in session data and permission checks.

```typescript
interface RoleItem = {
  name : String;
  value : Any;
}
```

| Field | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name  | The display name of the role (e.g., 'Admin', 'Editor'). This name will be used for reference and documentation purposes.                                                              |
| value | The internal value of the role, which will be stored in the `roleId` field of the user or session data. This value is used during authorization checks and can be a string or number. |

#### PermissionTypes

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines the active permission mechanisms in the project. Mindbricks supports multiple types of permission strategies including role-based (RBAC), user-specific overrides, user group-level permissions, object-level (OBAC), and tenant-specific rules. This configuration determines which of these models are enabled for the access control logic.

```typescript
interface PermissionTypes = {
  roleBasedPermissionsIsActive : Boolean;
  userBasedPermissionsIsActive : Boolean;
  userGroupBasedPermissionsIsActive : Boolean;
  objectBasedPermissionsIsActive : Boolean;
  tenantBasedPermissionsIsActive : Boolean;
}
```

| Field                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| roleBasedPermissionsIsActive      | Enables Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for the project. When active, permissions can be assigned to roles, and users inherit access through their roles.                                                   |
| userBasedPermissionsIsActive      | Enables user-specific permission overrides. When active, admins can assign custom permissions directly to individual users regardless of their roles or groups.                                              |
| userGroupBasedPermissionsIsActive | Enables permission control via user groups. When active, permissions can be assigned to defined user groups and inherited by all members.                                                                    |
| objectBasedPermissionsIsActive    | Enables Object-Based Access Control (OBAC). When active, permission rules can be defined per individual data object (e.g., per record) and evaluated dynamically based on the object's relation to the user. |
| tenantBasedPermissionsIsActive    | Activates tenant-specific permission logic. In multi-tenant projects, this allows SaaS administrators to define custom permission profiles per tenant, enabling isolated authorization policies.             |

#### OBACPermission

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Configuration for Object-Based Access Control (OBAC), which restricts access to specific data objects based on object ownership or association. If your system requires permissions that vary per object instance (e.g., 'only the creator can edit this record'), OBAC should be enabled and the relevant data objects listed.

```typescript
interface OBACPermission = {
  objectBasedPermissionsIsActive : Boolean;
  dataObjects : DataObjectName[];
}
```

| Field                          | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| objectBasedPermissionsIsActive | A boolean value that enables object-level permission checks. When true, permissions can be enforced per record based on ownership or related fields.     |
| dataObjects                    | An array of data object names to which object-level permissions will apply. These are the models for which individual access control should be enforced. |

#### DataObjectName

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Represents a reference to a data object within the project. The value can be either a simple object name or a qualified reference in the format 'serviceName:objectName'. When using the qualified format, the part before the ':' specifies the service name, and the part after specifies the object name within that service. If only a single name is provided (without ':'), the system first searches for the object in the current service, then searches across other services in the project. As a best practice, when referencing data objects from other services, always fully qualified 'serviceName:objectName' format should be used to avoid potential naming conflicts.

```typescript
interface DataObjectName = {
}
```

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |

#### AbacPermission

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Configuration for Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), allowing fine-grained permission control using attribute-level rules on data objects. ABAC evaluates access by applying custom filter conditions to each object. When a rule matches, the user session may be granted specific permissions or even dynamic roles for that object. These rules can supplement or override standard RBAC or OBAC logic.

```typescript
interface AbacPermission = {
  attributeBasedPermissionsIsActive : Boolean;
  abacDefinitions : ABACDefinititon[];
}
```

| Field                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| attributeBasedPermissionsIsActive | A boolean value that enables attribute-level access control. When true, data access will be filtered according to ABAC rules defined in `abacDefinitions`.                                                                        |
| abacDefinitions                   | An object array to define ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) rules. Each rule applies a conditional filter to determine which records a user can access, and grants either dynamic permissions or a role for matching records. |

#### ABACDefinititon

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines a single ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) rule for a given data object. Each rule applies a conditional filter to determine which records a user can access, and grants either dynamic permissions or a role for matching records.

```typescript
interface ABACDefinititon = {
  name : String;
  dataObject : DataObjectName;
  whereClause : MScript;
  permissions : String[];
}
```

| Field       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| name        | The unique identifier for this ABAC rule. It is used in the backend logic, database, and UI for reference.                                                                                                              |
| dataObject  | The name of the data object to which this ABAC rule applies.                                                                                                                                                            |
| whereClause | A JavaScript-style `where` clause defined using MScript syntax. This condition determines which records in the data object will match the rule and grant access.                                                        |
| permissions | A list of permission strings that will be granted when the ABAC rule matches a record. These permissions are context-specific and take precedence over less-specific permission types (such as role-based permissions). |

### SocialLoginSettings

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

### DataProperty

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

The definition of a data property within a data object. A data property is not just a storage field—it encapsulates the logic, behavior, and metadata associated with a specific piece of data. Through its settings, a data property can define relationships, context-aware values, session-based defaults, computed formulas, access filters, enums, and more. It serves as a powerful unit of business logic tightly integrated with the data model.

```typescript
interface DataProperty = {
  basicSettings : PropertyBasicSettings;
  indexSettings : PropertyIndexSettings;
  enumSettings : PropertyEnumSettings;
  relationSettings : PropertyRelation;
  sessionSettings : PropertySessionSettings;
  staticJoin : PropertyStaticJoin;
  formulaSettings : PropertyFormulaSettings;
  contextSettings : PropertyContextSettings;
  filterSettings : PropertyFilterSettings;

#### PropertyBasicSettings

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines the core structure and behavior of a data property. Beyond basic typing, this section governs how the property participates in data integrity, mutability, API exposure, and logic-driven behaviors such as hashing or auto-increment. Use this section to establish the foundational logic and identity of the property within your data object.

```typescript
interface PropertyBasicSettings = {
  name : String;
  type : DataTypes;
  isArray : Boolean;
  description : Text;
  isRequired : Boolean;
  allowUpdate : Boolean;
  requiredInUpdate : Boolean;
  allowAutoUpdate : Boolean;
  autoIncrement : Boolean;
  hashed : Boolean;
  defaultValues : PropertyDefaults;
}
```

| Field            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name             | Unique identifier for the property within the data object. This name is used throughout route definitions, generated code, and logic expressions. Use camelCase formatting, avoid spaces and special characters, and ensure the name is unique within the same data object. |
| type             | Defines the property's data type. Use a value from the `DataTypes`. The selected type impacts validation, storage schema, and frontend component inference.                                                                                                                 |
| isArray          | Indicates if the property stores multiple values (array). Supported by databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Default is `false`.                                                                                                                                           |
| description      | Optional textual description of the property's role in the domain. Useful for documentation and as a semantic hint across logic and UI components.                                                                                                                          |
| isRequired       | If `true`, this property must be provided when a new object is created. It is enforced during validation.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| allowUpdate      | Controls whether the property can be modified after creation. If `false`, updates to this field are ignored unless overridden explicitly.                                                                                                                                   |
| requiredInUpdate | If `true`, the property must be present in update operations. Commonly used for fields that must be kept consistent across updates (e.g. version, status).                                                                                                                  |
| allowAutoUpdate  | If `true`, this property will be automatically included in the update parameters for default routes unless custom logic is applied. Helps streamline generic update routes.                                                                                                 |
| autoIncrement    | If `true`, this property will be auto-generated by incrementing the latest existing value. Suitable for numeric IDs or sequences managed internally.                                                                                                                        |
| hashed           | If `true`, the property's value will be hashed before storage. This is irreversible and is typically used for storing passwords or other sensitive values.                                                                                                                  |
| defaultValues    | Defines default values to be used during create or update operations when the property is missing. Values must match the property's `type` and `isArray` setting in JSON format.                                                                                            |

#### PropertyDefaults

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines fallback values for create and update operations when the property is not explicitly provided. These settings ensure consistency and reduce frontend responsibility in form submission. Values must match the JSON representation of the property's `type` (`DataTypes`) and `isArray` setting. Examples: String→`"text"`, Integer→`123`, Boolean→`true`, Date→`"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"`, Enum→`"enumValueAsStr"`, Object→`{}`, or wrapped in arrays like `["text1","text2"]` when isArray=true. Note that the Enum type is represented by string value here instead of the Integer index.

```typescript
interface PropertyDefaults = {
  default : AnyComplex;
  defaultInUpdate : AnyComplex;
  alwaysCreateWithDefaultValue : Boolean;
}
```

| Field                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| default                      | Default value applied in create operations if the property is not provided. Commonly used to set initial values like statuses, flags, or timestamps. Set to `null` when no meaningful default exists. Value must match the property's `type` and `isArray` setting in JSON format.                                        |
| defaultInUpdate              | Default value applied in update operations if the property is required in update but not explicitly provided in the request payload. Set to `null` when no meaningful default exists. Value must match the property's `type` and `isArray` setting in JSON format.                                                        |
| alwaysCreateWithDefaultValue | If `true`, the default value will always be used during creation, even if the client provides a value for this property. This is useful for enforcing system-controlled initialization—such as setting fields based on minimal authorization rights—that should only be modified later by users with elevated privileges. |

#### PropertyIndexSettings

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Index configuration for the data property across supported storage and caching layers. This includes Elasticsearch indexing for query performance, relational database indexing for faster selection, and Redis-based optimizations for efficient cache invalidation and retrieval. Use these settings to control how the property contributes to performance, queryability, and caching logic.

```typescript
interface PropertyIndexSettings = {
  indexedInElastic : Boolean;
  fulltextSearch : Boolean;
  indexedInDb : Boolean;
  unique : Boolean;
  clusterInRedis : Boolean;
  cacheSelect : Boolean;
  isSecondaryKey : Boolean;
}
```

| Field            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| indexedInElastic | Determines whether the property is indexed in the Elasticsearch CQRS index. When enabled, this property can be used in DataView filters and search queries.                                                                                         |
| fulltextSearch   | If set to true, Mindbricks will create an additional text index in elastic search other than the type based term query. Note that this feature is ignored if indexedInElastic is false. Text type data properties are alread have full text search. |
| indexedInDb      | Specifies whether a native database index should be created for this property to accelerate selection queries. Recommended for frequently filtered or sorted fields.                                                                                |
| unique           | Indicates whether the property's value must be unique across all records. Enabling this will enforce a uniqueness constraint at the database level.                                                                                                 |
| clusterInRedis   | Specifies whether the property should contribute to Redis cluster keys for partial cache invalidation. This improves cache sensitivity but may increase Redis storage.                                                                              |
| cacheSelect      | Defines whether this property is used as a key in Redis entity cache for batch-select operations. Enables lookup by this value across cached entities.                                                                                              |
| isSecondaryKey   | Marks the property as a secondary identifier, improving query performance on non-primary keys. Useful for access tokens, slugs, or alternative keys.                                                                                                |

#### PropertyEnumSettings

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Enum configuration for the data property, applicable when the property type is set to Enum. While enum values are stored as integers in the database, defining the enum options here allows Mindbricks to enrich API responses with human-readable labels, easing interpretation and UI integration. If not defined, only the numeric value will be returned.

```typescript
interface PropertyEnumSettings = {
  hasEnumOptions : Boolean;
  configuration : PropertyEnumSettingsConfig;
}

#### PropertyEnumSettingsConfig

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Configuration settings for enum options in a data property. This object defines the symbolic names that the enum type property can have. These labels are used in generated documentation and API responses.

```typescript
interface PropertyEnumSettingsConfig = {
  enumOptions : String[];
}
```

| Field       | Description                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| enumOptions | An ordered list of enum string values representing the symbolic values that the enum property can have. |

#### PropertyRelation

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines the relationship configuration for the data property. This is used when the property acts as a foreign key referencing another data object. It allows setting up parent-child relationships, cascade behaviors, and enriches both code generation and documentation with relational semantics.

```typescript
interface PropertyRelation = {
  hasRelation : Boolean;
  configuration : PropertyRelationConfig;
}
```

| Field         | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| hasRelation   | Indicates whether this property represents a foreign key relationship to another data object. If enabled, additional settings like the target object and key must be provided. |
| configuration | The configuration object for the property relation. Leave it null if hasRelation is false.                                                                                     |

#### PropertyRelationConfig

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Configuration object for property relations. Defines the details of the foreign key relationship, including the relation name, target object, target key, parent/child semantics, delete behavior, and whether the relation is required. Used only if hasRelation is true.

```typescript
interface PropertyRelationConfig = {
  relationName : String;
  relationTargetObject : DataObjectName;
  relationTargetKey : PropRefer;
  onDeleteAction : RelationOnDeleteAction;
  relationIsRequired : Boolean;
}
```

| Field                | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| relationName         | A single-word, human-readable name that identifies the relationship. This name is used in generated code and documentation to represent joined data via this relation. |
| relationTargetObject | The name of the data object this property relates to. This defines the target of the foreign key relationship.                                                         |
| relationTargetKey    | The property name (usually 'id') in the target object that this property references. This is the destination key for the relation.                                     |
| onDeleteAction       | Determines what action should be taken if the related (parent) object is deleted. Options include cascading the delete or nullifying this property.                    |
| relationIsRequired   | Defines whether the relation is mandatory. If true, the property must always reference a valid record in the related data object.                                      |

#### RelationOnDeleteAction

Defines the available strategies for handling related records when a referenced (parent) object is deleted.

```js
RelationOnDeleteActionNames = ["doDelete", "setNull"];

const RelationOnDeleteAction = {
  doDelete: 0,
  setNull: 1,
};
```

| Enum     | Description                                                                                                                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| doDelete | Automatically delete this object if the referenced target object is deleted. This is a cascading delete.                         |
| setNull  | Set this property to null when the referenced object is deleted, effectively removing the relation without deleting this object. |

#### PropRefer

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Represents a reference to a property of a data object, optionally renaming it in the current context. It is a string data, however can store string pairs joined with ':'.The first part is the name ofthe property and the second part after ':' mark is how it will be renamed in the context. If no second partis provided, the property is named in the context with its original name. Renaming is useful for mapping remote object properties to local aliases or transforming naming for aggregation.

```typescript
interface PropRefer = {
}
```

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |

#### PropertySessionSettings

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines how this property is populated from the session context. Session-driven properties are commonly used to associate records with the current user or tenant automatically during create/update operations.

```typescript
interface PropertySessionSettings = {
  isSessionData : Boolean;
  configuration : PropertySessionSettingsConfig;
}
```

| Field         | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| isSessionData | Indicates whether this property is automatically populated from the session context. If true, additional configuration is required. |
| configuration | The configuration object for session mapping. Leave it null if isSessionData is false.                                              |

#### PropertySessionSettingsConfig

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Configuration object for session mapping. Defines the mapping between session properties and data object fields. This allows automatic population of data object properties from session data during create/update operations.

```typescript
interface PropertySessionSettingsConfig = {
  sessionParam : String;
  isOwnerField : Boolean;
}
```

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sessionParam | Specifies the name of the session field to bind to this property. Defaults to the property name if not explicitly provided. For example, if the session contains `userId`, that can be mapped to this field.                                                                                                   |
| isOwnerField | Marks this property as the ownership field for the data object. When true, the property is used to enforce ownership-based access control (e.g., ensuring users can only modify their own records). This should be used when the property semantically identifies the owner of the record, typically a userId. |

#### PropertyStaticJoin

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Static join settings define how this property's value is derived from another data object at the time of creation or update. This approach is useful when a field in the current object depends on a static value from a related object, and that value is not expected to change frequently. Unlike dynamic joins, static joins store the fetched value directly to allow for faster queries and avoid repeated lookups. A common use case is transferring tenant or client identifiers from a parent object into a child record. For example, when creating an email job for a specific user, the system can use the userId to join the User object, fetch its clientId, and statically assign it to the EmailJob object. This makes it easy to query email jobs by clientId without needing to join back to the User table at runtime. Note that, all static joins are executed before the property formula executions and the fetched data and read property (field) is written to the context like `this.product` and `this.amount`, so you can use these context data with in the calculated properties for either the same joint property or for another property.

```typescript
interface PropertyStaticJoin = {
  isStaticJoin : Boolean;
  configuration : PropertyStaticJoinConfig;
}
```

| Field         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| isStaticJoin  | Indicates whether this property should be populated from a static join with another data object. Static joins allow you to copy a fixed value from a related object (such as a foreign key reference) into this object at the time of creation or update. This enables fast lookups without needing runtime joins. Often used for propagating static values like tenantId, clientId, or status names. Enable this only when the source data is relatively stable and changes infrequently, as the joined value is stored statically and won't automatically update if the source changes. |
| configuration | The configuration object that defines the static join settings. Leave it null if the property is not a sttaic join.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

#### PropertyStaticJoinConfig

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Configuration object for static joins. This object contains the settings that define how the static join is established, including the source object, the field to be joined, and the keys used for matching records. It is used in conjunction with the `isStaticJoin` property to enable static joins in data objects.

```typescript
interface PropertyStaticJoinConfig = {
  jointSource : DataObjectName;
  jointRead : PropRefer;
  jointSourceKey : PropRefer;
  jointForeignKey : PropRefer;
}
```

| Field           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| jointSource     | The name and optionally the service of the source object from which the value will be joined. If the source is in another service, Mindbricks will automatically use Elasticsearch indexing to perform the join. |
| jointRead       | The name of the property in the source object whose value will be copied into the current property. Defaults to the same name as this property if not specified.                                                 |
| jointSourceKey  | The key in the source object used to identify the matching record. This is typically 'id' as the primary identifier of the source object. This field acts as the join source in the static join relationship.    |
| jointForeignKey | The property in the current object used as a reference to the source object (i.e., the foreign key). For example, if joining user.clientId via userId, the foreign key is 'userId'.                              |

#### PropertyFormulaSettings

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Specifies formula-based logic for computing the value of a data property. Use this when the property should not be directly provided by the user but instead derived through predefined calculations during create or update operations. Note that formula caluclations are made at the final point of the data clause building, so you can acess other property values that are populated from other sources. The formulas are calculated in create and update api's, so these API's will automatically manage the calculated population of the related properties. If you need more complex calculations in API level, you can use dataClause settings of the API combined with Api actions.

```typescript
interface PropertyFormulaSettings = {
  isCalculated : Boolean;
  configuration : PropertyFormulaSettingsConfig;
}
```

| Field         | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| isCalculated  | Indicates whether this property is calculated using an MScript formula. When enabled, the property’s value will be automatically derived instead of supplied directly by the client. |
| configuration | The configuration object for formula-based calculation. Leave it null if isCalculated is false.                                                                                      |

#### PropertyFormulaSettingsConfig

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Configuration object for formula-based calculation. Defines the primary formula and optional update formula for computed properties. This allows dynamic calculation of values during create or update operations.

```typescript
interface PropertyFormulaSettingsConfig = {
  formula : MScript;
  updateFormula : MScript;
  calculateWhenInputHas : PropRefer[];
  calculateAfterInstance : Boolean;
}
```

| Field                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| formula                | The primary MScript formula used to compute the property's value during creation or when no update-specific formula is defined. Use `this.{property}` syntax to access other values in the same request context.     |
| updateFormula          | Optional MScript formula to override the default formula during update operations. If omitted, the main formula will be used for updates as well.                                                                    |
| calculateWhenInputHas  | List of field names that trigger recalculation during updates. If any of these fields appear in the input, the formula will be re-evaluated. This is useful for dependent computations.                              |
| calculateAfterInstance | Indicates whether the formula should be executed after the full instance is created or loaded. This is necessary when the formula depends on values not present in the input but available only after instantiation. |

#### PropertyContextSettings

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines how this property is automatically populated from the request-time execution context. This is useful when the property value is fetched or computed externally before being written to the database—such as through API fetches, middleware injections, or upstream aggregations.

```typescript
interface PropertyContextSettings = {
  isContextData : Boolean;
  configuration : PropertyContextSettingsConfig;
}
```

| Field         | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| isContextData | Indicates whether this property derives its value from the execution context during a request. This enables dynamic assignment of the property using data available only at runtime. |
| configuration | The configuration object for context mapping. Leave it null if isContextData is false.                                                                                               |

#### PropertyContextSettingsConfig

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Configuration object for context mapping. Defines the mapping between context properties and data object fields. This allows automatic population of data object properties from context data during create/update operations.

```typescript
interface PropertyContextSettingsConfig = {
  contextParam : String;
}
```

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| contextParam | Specifies the key or path in the context object that holds the value for this property. Supports dot notation for nested context values (e.g., `company.name`). |

#### PropertyFilterSettings

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Specifies if a data property should be exposed as a query parameter for filtering in auto-generated list endpoints. This allows users to filter records by this field when retrieving data via GET routes. The presence of this configuration determines how the backend interprets and applies client-side query filters.

```typescript
interface PropertyFilterSettings = {
  isFilterParameter : Boolean;
  configuration : PropertyFilterSettingsConfig;
}
```

| Field             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| isFilterParameter | Determines whether the property can be used as a query parameter in list (GET) API routes. If enabled, clients can use this property to filter results when calling endpoints like `/customers`. The filtering logic is automatically handled based on the property type. |
| configuration     | The configuration object for filter settings. Leave it null if isFilterParameter is false.                                                                                                                                                                                |

#### PropertyFilterSettingsConfig

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Configuration object for filter settings. Defines the custom name of the filter parameter in the query string. This is useful when the external API should expose a different term than the internal field name.

```typescript
interface PropertyFilterSettingsConfig = {
  filterName : String;
}
```

| Field      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| filterName | Custom name of the filter parameter in the query string. Defaults to the property's name. This is useful when the external API should expose a different term than the internal field name. |

## BFFService

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

The BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) service is strongly recommended in microservice-based projects to simplify and optimize data access for frontend clients. As data is distributed across multiple services, the BFF service acts as a unified gateway that aggregates and delivers the necessary information in a single response. Mindbricks supports a hybrid CQRS architecture using DataViews, which represent structured aggregations of service data. These can be configured as either Static or Dynamic DataViews. Static DataViews are persisted in Elasticsearch and are ideal for performance-critical or cross-service filtered queries. Dynamic DataViews, on the other hand, fetch and assemble data on-the-fly during each request, making them suitable for user-specific or context-dependent views without storing the output. If no DataViews are defined, the BFF service will not be generated as part of the project.

```typescript
interface BFFService = {
  dataViews : DataView[];
}
```

| Field     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dataViews | A list of DataView definitions that describe how data should be aggregated and exposed by the BFF service. These views can be optionally persisted in Elasticsearch for efficient querying, or resolved dynamically depending on performance and use case. |

### DataView

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

A DataView defines an aggregated projection of data for the BFF service in Mindbricks. It serves as a unified structure that collects and combines information from multiple microservices. DataViews can be configured as either _stored_ or _dynamic_. Stored DataViews persist their results in Elasticsearch and are optimal for queries requiring filtering, sorting, or cross-service joins. Dynamic DataViews are assembled at runtime during the request cycle and are suitable for lightweight, user-specific, or real-time scenarios. Both types aim to simplify frontend development by consolidating distributed data into a single, queryable view.

```typescript
interface DataView = {
  viewBasics : ViewBasics;
  aggregates : ViewAggregate[];
  lookups : ViewLookup[];
  stats : ViewStat[];
}
```

| Field      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| viewBasics | Basic metadata and configuration for the DataView, including its name, storage strategy, source object, and selected properties. This section determines the fundamental structure and behavior of the view.                                    |
| aggregates | A list of aggregate definitions that perform data joins from related objects, similar to SQL joins. These are used to enrich the DataView with related datasets, such as joining orders into a customer view.                                   |
| lookups    | A list of lightweight lookup definitions used to fetch reference values, typically for UI display purposes (e.g., converting a userType ID into a localized label like 'Administrator'). These join single values from dictionary-like sources. |
| stats      | A list of statistical calculations performed within the view to enrich it with precomputed analytics.                                                                                                                                           |

#### ViewBasics

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Configuration for a DataView's identity and structure. It specifies whether the view is stored (in Elasticsearch) or dynamic (evaluated at runtime), the name of the view, the main source object it is built upon, and the list of core properties to retrieve from the main object.

```typescript
interface ViewBasics = {
  name : String;
  isStored : Boolean;
  mainObject : DataObjectName;
  properties : PropRefer[];
}
```

| Field      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| name       | A unique name for the DataView. Avoid using a name that matches any existing data object to prevent conflicts. Prefer descriptive names like 'UserDetailsView' that clearly indicate the view's purpose.                 |
| isStored   | A boolean value that indicates whether the view is persisted in Elasticsearch. Set this to true for performance-optimized, filterable views. Set to false for dynamic, real-time data aggregations executed per request. |
| mainObject | The primary data object or existing view that the DataView is structured around. This object serves as the root of the aggregation.                                                                                      |
| properties | An array of property names from the main object that should be included in the view's result.                                                                                                                            |

#### ViewAggregate

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines an aggregate (join) within a DataView that links related objects to the main object, similar to SQL-style joins. Aggregates are resolved at the Elasticsearch layer using replicated microservice data. Each aggregate pulls in one or more records from a child object based on matching keys and optional conditions, then embeds them under the specified property name in the final view output.

```typescript
interface ViewAggregate = {
  name : String;
  childObject : DataObjectName;
  parentKey : PropRefer;
  childKey : PropRefer;
  oneToMany : Boolean;
  condition : MScript;
  properties : PropRefer[];
  checkIn : MScript;
}
```

| Field       | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name        | The property name under which the joined data will be added in the DataView. This is typically a descriptive alias for the child object, like 'userRoles' or 'companyInfo'. |
| childObject | The name of the data object being joined (child object). This is the source of the aggregated data.                                                                         |
| parentKey   | The key field from the main object used to perform the join. Often this is a foreign key like 'companyId' or 'userId'.                                                      |
| childKey    | The key field from the child object that is matched against the parent key. Typically this would be the child's primary identifier or a linking field.                      |
| oneToMany   | Specifies whether the relationship is one-to-many (true) or one-to-one (false). If true, the result will be an array of records from the child object.                      |
| condition   | An MScript condition evaluated on the main object to decide whether this aggregation should be executed.                                                                    |
| properties  | The list of property names to extract from the child object. Only these fields will be included in the aggregated result.                                                   |
| checkIn     | An MScript condition evaluated on each child record to determine whether it should be included in the final aggregation result.                                             |

#### ViewLookup

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines a lookup operation in a DataView, typically used to enrich an object with a human-readable label or translated text from a dictionary index. Lookups are similar to aggregates but are optimized for fetching a single value, such as a label, for UI rendering. They are especially useful for localization (e.g., converting 'userType: 0' to 'Administrator') or enriching records with descriptive names from static dictionaries like country, city, or status lists. Multi-language lookups automatically resolve language-specific values based on the user's locale if the view is dynamic; if stored, all language variants are stored with suffixes.

```typescript
interface ViewLookup = {
  name : String;
  lookupDict : String;
  multiLang : Boolean;
  lookupKey : String;
  lookupValue : String;
}
```

| Field       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name        | The name of the lookup field in the DataView output. This is the property that will hold the resolved value, such as 'userRoleName'. For stored DataViews, Mindbricks stores multilingual variants using suffixes like 'userRoleName_en', 'userRoleName_tr'. When returned to the client, only the relevant language value is exposed. |
| lookupDict  | The name of the dictionary index where the lookup value resides. This can be any dictionary-like dataset, such as countries, roles, or labels. For multilingual dictionaries, Mindbricks automatically appends the language suffix (e.g., '\_en', '\_tr') to the index name during lookup.                                             |
| multiLang   | Whether the lookup dictionary is multilingual. If true, Mindbricks will automatically manage language-specific fields and suffixes. If false, a single language-independent value is returned.                                                                                                                                         |
| lookupKey   | The key field in the main object (or its aggregates) used to match against the dictionary index. This is typically a reference like 'roleId' or 'countryId'. The dictionary index's target key is always assumed to be 'id'.                                                                                                           |
| lookupValue | The field in the dictionary index whose value will be returned. For example, 'name' or 'label'. This is what will appear in the DataView as the resolved text.                                                                                                                                                                         |

#### ViewStat

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines a statistical aggregation for a DataView. Unlike ViewAggregates that collect related records, ViewStats compute mathematical summaries such as sum, count, average, min, and max over grouped data. These groupings, or 'buckets', are constructed based on parent-child relationships between objects. This is conceptually similar to Elasticsearch's bucket-based aggregations. Each ViewStat joins the main object with a target object (child) using a foreign key relationship and computes one or more aggregates using the defined conditions. It's ideal for summarizing numerical data across associations, such as counting user orders or summing revenue per company.

```typescript
interface ViewStat = {
  name : String;
  childObject : DataObjectName;
  parentKey : PropRefer;
  childKey : PropRefer;
  select : MScript;
  aggList : AggregateItem[];
}
```

| Field       | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| name        | The name of the statistic in the DataView result. This will appear as a property in the view (e.g., 'totalRevenue', 'userOrderCount').                       |
| childObject | The name of the target object to aggregate data from (e.g., orders, sessions, transactions). Can also be a previously defined view.                          |
| parentKey   | The key from the main object that groups the stat results. Acts as the bucket owner (e.g., userId if calculating per user).                                  |
| childKey    | The foreign key in the target object used to relate it back to the main object. Typically a reference like 'userId' or 'companyId'.                          |
| select      | An optional MScript filter applied before bucketing. Use this to narrow the child data (e.g., only 'canceled' orders in the last month).                     |
| aggList     | The list of AggregateItems to apply on the grouped buckets. Each defines a numeric operation like sum, count, average. If empty, a default count is applied. |

#### AggregateItem

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines a single mathematical operation to apply to a group of records within a ViewStat. Supports standard operations like sum, average, min, max, and count. Each AggregateItem targets a specific field in the child object and may apply additional filters. It is particularly useful when multiple grouped metrics are required from the same set of joined records, such as 'count of failed orders' vs. 'sum of successful order values'.

```typescript
interface AggregateItem = {
  name : String;
  aggType : AggTypes;
  aggField : PropRefer;
  dataType : DataTypes;
  filterValue : MScript;
}
```

| Field       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| name        | The identifier of the computed metric (e.g., 'orderCount', 'totalAmount'). Appears as a key in the result object.                                                                                            |
| aggType     | The mathematical operation to perform (e.g., 'value_count', 'sum', 'average', 'min', 'max').                                                                                                                 |
| aggField    | The field of the target object used in the aggregation (e.g., 'amount', 'id'). For count operations, typically use 'id'.                                                                                     |
| dataType    | The expected data type of the result (e.g., 'Integer', 'Float'). Often reflects the type of the aggField but may differ (e.g., averaging integers produces floats).                                          |
| filterValue | Optional MScript condition to filter records inside the bucket before applying the operation. Allows multiple filtered aggregations on the same group (e.g., 'totalCanceledAmount', 'totalCompletedAmount'). |

#### AggTypes

Specifies the type of aggregation to perform.

```js
AggTypesNames = ["value_count", "sum", "avg", "min", "max"];

const AggTypes = {
  value_count: 0,
  sum: 1,
  avg: 2,
  min: 3,
  max: 4,
};
```

| Enum        | Description                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| value_count | Count the number of records.           |
| sum         | Sum the values of the records.         |
| avg         | Average the values of the records.     |
| min         | Find the minimum value of the records. |
| max         | Find the maximum value of the records. |

## NotificationService

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines the global notification configuration for the project. This includes providers for different notification channels and the list of event-driven notification behaviors triggered by Kafka messages.

```typescript
interface NotificationService = {
  serviceSettings : NotificationServiceSettings;
  eventNotifications : EventNotification[];
}
```

| Field              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Service

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines the overall structure and configuration for a microservice within the project. Each service acts as an independent domain that encapsulates its own data model, business logic, and interface behaviors. While services primarily manage and expose domain-specific data, this module extends beyond basic CRUD operations by offering customizable patterns, libraries, authentication, and specialized route handling. Use this module to tailor the internal and external behaviors of your service—whether it's securing endpoints, defining edge routes, managing complex data objects, or integrating advanced logic. The service configuration ensures the resulting microservice is robust, secure, and aligned with the specific application requirements.

```typescript
interface Service = {
  serviceSettings : ServiceSettings;
  dataObjects : DataObject[];
  businessLogic : BusinessApi[];
  library : ServiceLibrary;
  edgeControllers : EdgeController[];
}
```

| Field           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| serviceSettings | The general configuration for the service, including its basic metadata and authentication rules. This sets foundational behavior such as login requirements and token usage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| dataObjects     | An array of data object definitions representing the internal data schema of the service. Each object defines its fields, relations, and business logic behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| businessLogic   | BusinessApi enables the creation of sophisticated backend operations through declarative configuration. It should be used when a project needs to expose business logic as APIs - whether through REST endpoints, real-time WebSocket connections, event-driven Kafka handlers, or scheduled cron jobs. BusinessApi automatically handles CRUD operations on data objects, parameter extraction from multiple sources (request body, Redis, session), authentication, and complex workflows with validation, transformations, and inter-service calls. Use BusinessApi when you need to create, read, update, or delete data, process events, schedule background tasks, or orchestrate multi-step business operations without writing custom backend code. |
| library         | The service's function library where custom business logic is written. Includes edge functions, and shared utilities callable across routes and controllers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| edgeControllers | A set of custom controller endpoints defined at the edge of the service, each connected to a function from the service library. Edge controllers offer custom REST APIs beyond the auto-generated business APIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### ServiceSettings

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines the foundational settings of the service module, including basic metadata and authentication configurations. These settings must be established before designing the service's data model. They determine the service's identity, behavior within the project, and how it handles authentication. This configuration acts as the entry point for service-level behavior, ensuring consistency and security from the outset of development.

```typescript
interface ServiceSettings = {
  serviceBasics : ServiceBasics;
  serviceOptions : ServiceOptions;
}
```

| Field          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| frontendDocument | A text based information to inform the frontend developer or frontend AI agent about the service specific UX behaviour of the service logic based on user stories and use cases. The format may be either text or markdown(recommended). Write the document as an AI prompt and describe service gneric UX behaviours. Any data object specific information should be given as a brief key sentence, since they will be detailed in their own objects. Note that this document will be given to the AI agent or human developer combined with all technical details that is generated from the servic design,so this document should only focus on service-specific behavioral UX business logic. |
| customVariables  | A list of custom key-value pairs that will be available to all scripts and functions within the service. Useful for environment-specific settings or reusable values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| nodejsPackages   | A list of npm packages to be added to the nodejs package json of the service.

interface ServiceOptions = {
  serviceRequiresLogin : Boolean;
  serviceAllowsUserToLogin : Boolean;
  httpPort : Integer;
  routerSuffix : String;
  dataModelName : String;
  dbType : DbTypes;
  useSoftDelete : Boolean;
}
```

| Field                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| serviceRequiresLogin     | If true, all API calls to this service require a valid login token unless explicitly marked otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| serviceAllowsUserToLogin | Keep this false unless you know what you are doing. If true, the service provides login endpoints for users, allowing it to act as an authentication provider. This option is used if you want to make your own auth/user service instead of the default one created with authentication module configuration. |
| httpPort                 | The port number that the service will use to listen for HTTP traffic. Recommended to use ports in the 3000-3099 range for consistency across microservices.                                                                                                                                                    |
| routerSuffix             | Use this in your custom deployment if you have any suffix in your service url to be removed before evaluated in express router. AI Agents should keep this null.                                                                                                                                               |
| dataModelName            | The name identifier of the data model configuration. For current Mindbricks versions, use 'main' or 'default'. In future versions with support for multiple data models per service, this name will distinguish them.                                                                                          |
| dbType                   | Specifies the type of database engine used for storing the service's data. It must be one of the values in the DbTypes enum. Currently, PostgreSQL is fully supported; MongoDB is in beta.                                                                                                                     |
| useSoftDelete            | Indicates whether records are soft-deleted (i.e., marked inactive using an 'isActive' flag) instead of being physically removed from the database. This setting applies globally unless overridden at the data object level.                                                                                   |

#### DbTypes

Enumeration of supported database types for service-level data models.

```js
DbTypesNames = ["postgresql", "mongodb"];

const DbTypes = {
  postgresql: 0,
  mongodb: 1,
};
```

| Enum       | Description                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| postgresql | Use PostgreSQL for relational database management.                  |
| mongodb    | Use MongoDB for document-oriented data storage (currently in beta). |

### DataObject

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

A DataObject is the core building block of a service in Mindbricks. It represents both the data schema (like a table in SQL or a collection in MongoDB) and the business logic that operates around it. Each DataObject includes a set of DataProperties (fields), and it governs how the data is stored, validated, secured, and exposed through automatically generated business APIs. Beyond simple data modeling, DataObjects enable complex logic configurations, such as access control, field-level behaviors, validation, and custom API route behavior. They serve not only as data containers but also as logical units of functionality within the microservice.

```typescript
interface DataObject = {
  objectSettings : ObjectSettings;
  properties : DataProperty[];
}
```

| Field          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| objectSettings | Settings that define general behavior and characteristics of the data object, such as naming, indexing, visibility, and access options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| properties     | The list of data properties of the data object. Each property represents a field and encapsulates both the type of the data and behavioral configurations like default values, constraints, visibility, or computed logic. Note: Mindbricks automatically creates standard fields (`id`, `isActive`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`), so avoid defining these manually. |

#### ObjectSettings

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Configuration settings that govern the behavior, access control, and optimization strategies of a data object. These settings allow fine-grained control over how the data object behaves in terms of authorization, caching, indexing, payment processing, and membership relationships. This is the central point to define how the object integrates with infrastructure and security policies in a microservice.

```typescript
interface ObjectSettings = {
  basicSettings : ObjectBasicSettings;
  authorization : ObjectAuthorization;
  redisEntityCacheSettings : RedisEntityCacheSettings;
  compositeIndexSettings : CompositeIndex[];
  stripeOrder : StripeOrder;
  membershipSettings : MembershipSettings;
}
```

| Field                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| basicSettings            | Core definitions of the data object such as its name, label, and description. These settings influence how the object appears in documentation and interfaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| authorization            | Rules and permissions that control access to this data object. These object-level rules enhance or override project-level authorization to implement fine-grained security models.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| redisEntityCacheSettings | Configuration for enabling Redis-based entity-level caching. Useful for frequently accessed, lightweight records that benefit from high-speed lookups and smart cache invalidation.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| compositeIndexSettings   | Defines one or more composite indexes to ensure uniqueness across multiple fields and improve the efficiency of compound queries. This is especially critical for enforcing business constraints or query performance in relational databases. Please note that if you need unique constraints on a single field, you can use the `unique` property of the DataProperty instead.   |
| stripeOrder              | Activates e-commerce order support for the data object through Stripe integration. Automatically configures order and payment processing infrastructure when the object represents billable entities like purchases or subscriptions.                                                                                                                                              |
| membershipSettings       | Settings to enable access control for this object through an external membership relationship. This object represents the protected resource (such as a project), and access to it is managed by another object (such as projectMember) that links users or roles to this resource. Useful in multi-user collaboration domains where permissions are scoped per resource instance. |

#### ObjectBasicSettings

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Basic configuration for a data object, including its identity, documentation, and deletion strategy. A data object acts as a logical model for a database table or MongoDB collection, and is central to defining how data is stored, queried, and managed within a microservice.

```typescript
interface ObjectBasicSettings = {
  name : String;
  description : Text;
  frontendDocument : Text;
  useSoftDelete : Boolean;
}
```

| Field            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name             | A unique identifier for the data object used consistently across generated code, API routes, and documentation. The name must be a single, camelCase word without spaces or special characters, and should be unique within the project. Use a singular noun that clearly represents the entity (e.g., 'product', 'order', 'task').                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| description      | A descriptive explanation of what the data object represents. This description is used in documentation and helps clarify the business domain the object serves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| frontendDocument | A text based information to inform the frontend developer or frontend AI agent about the data object specific UX behaviour of the data object logic based on user stories and use cases. The format may be either text or markdown(recommended). Write the document as an AI prompt and describe data object specific UX behaviours. Note that this document will be given to the AI agent or human developer combined with all technical details that is generated from the data object design,so this document should only focus on data object-specific behavioral UX business logic. |
| useSoftDelete    | Overrides the default data model setting to enable or disable soft deletion for this object. If enabled, records will not be physically deleted but marked inactive using an 'isActive' flag. These records will be excluded from normal queries unless explicitly requested.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

#### ObjectAuthorization

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines access control scope for this data object, including tenant scoping and public accessibility. These settings are applied globally unless explicitly overridden at the Business API level.

```typescript
interface ObjectAuthorization = {
  dataObjectAccess : DataObjectAccess;
  objectDataIsInTenantLevel : Boolean;
}
```

| Field                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dataObjectAccess          | Specifies the default access level for this DataObject and its related get/list APIs. The value is defined by the DataObjectAccess enum, which determines whether the object is private (restricted to owner/admins), protected (available to all authenticated project users), or public (open to everyone, including anonymous). API-level configurations may override this default. |
| objectDataIsInTenantLevel | Determines whether this object is scoped per tenant in a multi-tenant architecture. If true, an implicit tenant ID field (e.g., clientId) will be added to segregate data per tenant. Use this for tenant-owned data like projects or documents.                                                                                                                                       |

#### DataObjectAccess

Defines the possible access levels for a DataObject. This type captures whether the object is only visible to its owner/admins (private), shared with authenticated project users (protected), or exposed to the public including anonymous users (public). The key difference is between restricted vs. shared access, and within shared access whether authentication is required.

```js
DataObjectAccessNames = ["accessPrivate", "accessProtected", "accessPublic"];

const DataObjectAccess = {
  accessPrivate: 0,
  accessProtected: 1,
  accessPublic: 2,
};
```

| Enum            | Description                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| accessPrivate   | Only the object owner and system administrators can access. |
| accessProtected | All authenticated project users can access.                 |
| accessPublic    | All users, including anonymous, can access.                 |

#### RedisEntityCacheSettings

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Configuration for Redis-based entity-level caching. Enables fast access to frequently used data by storing and serving object-level records from Redis, with support for custom cache criteria and smart expiration.

```typescript
interface RedisEntityCacheSettings = {
  useEntityCaching : Boolean;
  configuration : RedisEntityCacheConfig;
}
```

| Field            | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| useEntityCaching | Enables Redis entity caching for this object. When active, individual records are cached in Redis, improving read performance for high-frequency access patterns. |
| configuration    | Configuration settings for Redis entity caching. Includes cache criteria and expiration logic. Leave it null if useEntityCaching is false.                        |

#### RedisEntityCacheConfig

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Configuration for Redis-based entity-level caching. Enables fast access to frequently used data by storing and serving object-level records from Redis, with support for custom cache criteria and smart expiration.

```typescript
interface RedisEntityCacheConfig = {
  useSmartCaching : Boolean;
  cacheCriteria : MScript;
  checkCriteriaOnlyInCreateAndUpdates : Boolean;
}
```

| Field                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| useSmartCaching                     | Activates smart cache expiration logic. TTL (time-to-live) is dynamically calculated based on access frequency, which is useful for large datasets with volatile usage patterns.                                                                                     |
| cacheCriteria                       | A condition (written as an MScript Query object) that determines whether a specific record should be cached. Useful for filtering which records are cache-worthy (e.g., only active events, unexpired tickets).                                                      |
| checkCriteriaOnlyInCreateAndUpdates | If true, cache criteria will be evaluated only during create and update operations, ideal for conditions based solely on internal record fields. Set false to re-evaluate criteria at read time when the condition depends on external context (e.g., current date). |

#### CompositeIndex

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines a composite index for a data object. Composite indexes improve database performance for queries that filter or sort based on multiple fields. Each index is created at the database level and can optionally handle duplicate conflicts during insert operations. Note that if you need unique constraints on a single field, you can use the `unique` property of the DataProperty instead. Composite indexes are particularly useful for optimizing complex queries that involve multiple fields, such as searching for users by email and client ID simultaneously or whne you need to ensure uniqueness across multiple fields (e.g., email and clientId). They are defined at the data object level and will be used across all related Business APIs.

```typescript
interface CompositeIndex = {
  indexName : String;
  indexFields : PropRefer[];
  onDuplicate : OnDuplicate;
}
```

| Field       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| indexName   | Unique name of the database index. Used in DDL statements and must be unique within the scope of the current data object. Choose a descriptive name that reflects the indexed fields (e.g., userEmailIndex). |
| indexFields | List of field names that form the composite index. The order of fields matters for query optimization. For example, ['email', 'clientId'] allows fast lookups for email within a specific client context.    |
| onDuplicate | Defines the behavior when an insert operation encounters a duplicate key on this index. Options include updating the existing row or throwing an error. Useful for implementing upsert logic.                |

#### OnDuplicate

Enumeration that defines the conflict resolution strategy when a new record would violate a composite index constraint.

```js
OnDuplicateNames = ["doUpdate", "throwError", "stopOperation", "doInsert"];

const OnDuplicate = {
  doUpdate: 0,
  throwError: 1,
  stopOperation: 2,
  doInsert: 3,
};
```

| Enum          | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| doUpdate      | Update the existing record if a duplicate key is encountered. Equivalent to an upsert operation.                                                                       |
| throwError    | Throw a database error when a duplicate key is encountered. Prevents the insertion of conflicting data.                                                                |
| stopOperation | Stop the operation silently if a duplicate key is encountered. The existing record remains unchanged and no error is thrown.                                           |
| doInsert      | Proceed with the operation without checking for duplicates. Use this option when your composite index is designed for search purposes only and duplicates are allowed. |

#### StripeOrder

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines the settings for integrating this data object with Stripe to handle e-commerce orders and payments. When enabled, Mindbricks automatically generates the required logic and auxiliary objects for managing payment workflows. Ensure Stripe credentials are set at the project level to activate this integration.

```typescript
interface StripeOrder = {
  objectIsAnOrderObject : Boolean;
  configuration : StripeOrderConfig;
}
```

| Field                 | Description                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| objectIsAnOrderObject | Enables Stripe order logic for this object. When true, the object is treated as an order and integrated with Stripe payment flows. |
| configuration         | The configuration object for Stripe order integration. Leave it null if objectIsAnOrderObject is false.                            |

| description                   | MScript expression for the order description, shown in Stripe and receipts.                                                                |
| orderStatusProperty           | The field name in the data object that holds the current order status. This will be automatically updated based on payment results.        |
| orderStatusUpdateDateProperty | The field name that records the timestamp of the last order status update. This is auto-managed during payment events.                     |
| orderOwnerIdProperty          | The field that holds the ID of the user who owns the order. This is used to ensure correct access control in payment flows.                |
| mapPaymentResultToOrderStatus | Defines how Stripe's payment results (started, success, failed, canceled) map to internal order statuses using MScript expressions.        |
| onCheckoutError               | Determines the system's behavior if a checkout error occurs. Options are 'continueRoute' to proceed or 'throwError' to stop with an error. |

#### OnCheckoutError

Enum options for handling errors that occur during the Stripe checkout process.

```js
OnCheckoutErrorNames = ["continueRoute", "throwError"];

const OnCheckoutError = {
  continueRoute: 0,

#### MembershipSettings

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Configuration settings for membership-based access control of a data object. This object does not define access itself but relies on a separate membership data object to manage which users can access this data object. For example, an 'organization' object might have access control defined through an 'organizationMember' object, which holds references to both the user and the organization.

```typescript
interface MembershipSettings = {
  hasMembership : Boolean;
  configuration : MembershipSettingsConfig;

| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| hasMembership | Indicates whether this data object uses an external membership object to manage access rights. If set to true, access to this object is governed by entries in another object. Default is false. |
| configuration | The configuration object for membership settings. Leave it null if hasMembership is false.                                                                                                       |

#### MembershipSettingsConfig

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Configuration settings for membership-based access control of a data object. This object does not define access itself but relies on a separate membership data object to manage which users can access this data object. For example, an 'organization' object might have access control defined through an 'organizationMember' object, which holds references to both the user and the organization.

```typescript
interface MembershipSettingsConfig = {
  membershipObjectName : DataObjectName;
  membershipObjectIdProperty : PropRefer;
  membershipUserIdProperty : PropRefer;
  membershipStatusCheck : MScript;
}
```

| Field                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| membershipObjectName       | Specifies the name of the external data object used to manage membership. This object contains membership entries linking users to this object.                                                                      |
| membershipObjectIdProperty | The field name in the membership object that refers back to this data object (e.g., organizationId). It links the membership entry to this object.                                                                   |
| membershipUserIdProperty   | The field name in the membership object that refers to the user who holds membership. This is typically linked to the user's session during authorization checks.                                                    |
| membershipStatusCheck      | Optional MScript condition to determine if a membership entry is valid. Can be used to check fields like status, startDate, or endDate. This filter is applied at query time when evaluating access. Example: `{ age: { $gte: 18 } }` |

### BusinessApi

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines a Business API, a high-level abstraction representing a specific business operation on a primary data object. It encapsulates intent (e.g., get, create, delete), parameters, trigger mechanisms, and a structured workflow composed of modular actions. Each Business API offers more expressive and decoupled control over behavior and access.

```typescript
interface BusinessApi = {
  apiOptions : ApiOptions;
  authOptions : ApiAuthOptions;
  customParameters : BusinessApiParameter[];
  redisParameters : RedisApiParameter[];
  restSettings : ApiRestSettings;
  grpcSettings : ApiGrpcSettings;
  kafkaSettings : ApiKafkaSettings;
  socketSettings : ApiSocketSettings;
  cronSettings : ApiCronSettings;
  selectClause : SelectClauseSettings;
  dataClause : DataClauseSettings;
  whereClause : WhereClauseSettings;
  deleteOptions : DeleteOptions;
  getOptions : GetOptions;
  listOptions : ListOptions;
  paginationOptions : PaginationOptions;
  actions : BusinessApiActionStore;
  workflow : BusinessWorkflow;
}
```

| Field             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| apiOptions        | Defines the name,type, dataObject and description of the business api as well as its basic options                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| authOptions       | Defines core authentication and authorization settings for a Business API. These settings cover session validation, role and ownership checks, and access scope (e.g., tenant vs. SaaS-level). While these options are sufficient for most use cases, more fine-grained access control—such as conditional permissions or contextual ownership—should be implemented using explicit access control actions (e.g., `PermissionCheckAction`, `MembershipCheckAction`, `ObjectPermissionCheckAction`). |
| customParameters  | An array of manually defined parameters that are extracted from the incoming request (e.g., body, query, session). These are configured using `BusinessApiParameter` and are written to the context as `this.<name>` before workflow execution begins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| redisParameters   | An array of parameters fetched from Redis based on dynamically computed keys. These are defined using `RedisApiParameter` and are written to the context as `this.<name>`, just like custom parameters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| restSettings      | Defines HTTP REST controller settings such as method and route path. Automatically generated using naming conventions, but can be customized for fine-grained control over REST behavior, parameter mapping, or URL design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| grpcSettings      | Enables gRPC access for this Business API and configures the request and response schemas. gRPC is disabled by default unless explicitly configured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| kafkaSettings     | Enables this Business API to be triggered by Kafka events. This controller listens for messages published to configured Kafka topics, allowing the API to respond to system-level events (e.g., file uploaded, user signed up) or external integrations. This is commonly used for decoupled orchestration between services or for reacting to events emitted by backend libraries and storage providers.                                                                                           |
| socketSettings    | Enables invocation of this Business API over WebSocket channels. Useful for real-time communication where APIs must respond to push-based client interactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| cronSettings      | Schedules this Business API for automatic execution at specified intervals. Useful for background tasks, data cleanup, or scheduled jobs. Uses cron expressions to define timing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| selectClause      | Specifies which fields will be selected from the main data object during a `get` or `list` operation. Leave blank to select all properties. This applies only to `get` and `list` type APIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| dataClause        | Defines custom field-value assignments used to modify or augment the default payload for `create` and `update` operations. These settings override values derived from the session or parameters if explicitly provided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| whereClause       | Defines the criteria used to locate the target record(s) for the main operation. This is expressed as a query object and applies to `get`, `list`, `update`, and `delete` APIs. All API types except `list` are expected to affect a single record.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| deleteOptions     | Contains settings specific to `delete` type APIs, such as soft-delete configurations or cascade options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| getOptions        | Contains settings specific to `get` type APIs, such as instance enrichment, fallback behaviors, or object caching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| listOptions       | Defines list-specific options including filtering logic, default sorting, and result customization for APIs that return multiple records.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| paginationOptions | Contains settings to configure pagination behavior for `list` APIs. Includes options like page size, offset, cursor support, and total count inclusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| actions           | Represents the available logic actions that can be referenced by the Business API's workflow. Actions include data fetches, validation, permission checks, interservice calls, transformations, and output shaping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| workflow          | Defines the logical flow of the Business API, composed of sequenced action ids grouped by lifecycle stages. This workflow is generated visually in the architecture UI or programmatically inferred from the API's type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

#### ApiOptions

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Main configuration section for a Business API. This object includes essential attributes such as naming, access control, event handling, input generation, and fallback strategies. In many cases, configuring this section alone is sufficient to define the primary behavior of an API entry point.

```typescript
interface ApiOptions = {
  dataObjectName : LocalDataObjectName;
  crudType : CrudTypes;
  name : String;
  apiDescription : Text;
  frontendDocument : Text;
  raiseApiEvent : Boolean;
  raiseDbLevelEvents : Boolean;
  autoParams : Boolean;
  readFromEntityCache : Boolean;

| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dataObjectName      | Specifies the primary data object that this Business API interacts with. This object is the core target of the API's operation, such as reading, updating, or deleting records.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| crudType            | Defines the primary operation type for this API. Possible values are `get`, `list`, `create`, `update`, and `delete`. This classification drives the behavior and flow of the API lifecycle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| name                | A unique, human-readable name for the API, used for referencing in documentation and the UI. This is not a code-level identifier; instead, generated class and function names are derived from this value. Use camelCase formatting, avoid spaces or special characters, and ensure uniqueness within the same service. If you want the API to behave like a default RESTful endpoint, use a verb-noun combination like `createUser`, `getOrder`, or `deleteItem`, which will enforce expected parameters and URL patterns (e.g., `/users/:userId`).           |
| apiDescription      | A brief explanation of the API's business purpose or logic. Helps clarify its intent for developers and documentation readers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| frontendDocument    | A text based information to inform the frontend developer or frontend AI agent about the api specific UX behaviour of the api logic based on user stories and use cases. The format may be either text or markdown(recommended). Write the document as an AI prompt and describe api specific UX behaviours. Note that this document will be given to the AI agent or human developer combined with all technical details that is generated from the business api design,so this document should only focus on data api-specific behavioral UX business logic. |
| raiseApiEvent       | Indicates whether the Business API should emit an API-level event after successful execution. This is typically used for audit trails, analytics, or external integrations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| raiseDbLevelEvents  | If true, database-level events will be emitted for each affected data object. This is useful for APIs that interact with multiple related objects and need fine-grained event tracking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| autoParams          | Determines whether input parameters should be auto-generated from the schema of the associated data object. Set to `false` if you want to define all input parameters manually.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| readFromEntityCache | If enabled, the API will attempt to read the target object from the Redis entity cache before querying the database. This can improve performance for frequently accessed records.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

#### CrudTypes

CrudTypes define the fundamental operation mode of a route. Each route is classified by a CRUD type that reflects its intended data operation: create, update, read, or delete.

```js
CrudTypesNames = ["create", "update", "get", "list", "delete"];

const CrudTypes = {
  create: 0,
  update: 1,
  get: 2,
  list: 3,
  delete: 4,
};
```

| Enum   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| create | Specifies that the route handles creation operations. It inserts a new record into the associated data object. Mindbricks auto-generates default behavior for create routes, but custom logic can be defined via the route’s createSettings.          |
| update | Specifies that the route handles update operations for a single existing record. The primary access criterion is the record's ID. Mindbricks auto-generates default behavior for update routes, but customizations can be added using updateSettings. |
| get    | Specifies that the route retrieves a single record of the data object. The primary access criterion is the record's ID. Mindbricks provides default logic, but route-specific getSettings can be applied for custom retrieval.                        |
| list   | Specifies that the route retrieves multiple records of the data object. By default, results are filtered by authorization rules. List-level customizations can be configured through listOptions and paginationOptions                                |
| delete | Specifies that the route handles deletion of a single record. The access criterion is the record's ID. Mindbricks supports both hard and soft deletes, with behavior controlled through deleteOptions.                                                |

#### LocalDataObjectName

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Represents a reference to a data object within the same service. The value must be a simple object name; not a qualified reference in the format 'serviceName:objectName'.

```typescript
interface LocalDataObjectName = {
}
```

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |

#### ApiAuthOptions

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines core authentication and authorization settings for a Business API. These settings cover session validation, role and ownership checks, and access scope (e.g., tenant vs. SaaS-level). While these options are sufficient for most use cases, more fine-grained access control—such as conditional permissions or contextual ownership—should be implemented using explicit access control actions (e.g., `PermissionCheckAction`, `MembershipCheckAction`, `ObjectPermissionCheckAction`).

```typescript
interface ApiAuthOptions = {
  apiInSaasLevel : Boolean;
  loginRequired : Boolean;
  ownershipCheck : Boolean;
  parentOwnershipChecks : String[];
  absoluteRoles : String[];
  checkRoles : String[];
  defaultPermissions : String[];
}
```

| Field                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| apiInSaasLevel        | If true, this API can be accessed across tenants (SaaS-wide). This bypasses tenant ID filtering and is only allowed for users with SaaS-level roles. Use this for global admin tools or cross-tenant analytics.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| loginRequired         | Specifies whether the user must be authenticated to access the API. By default, this inherits the login requirement from the associated data object, but it can be overridden here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ownershipCheck        | Defines whether ownership should be enforced on the main data object. This check restricts access to the object’s owner and will be applied via the query in list operations and after the instance is fetched in others.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| parentOwnershipChecks | Specifies additional parent objects (e.g., `organization`, `project`) whose ownership must also be verified. This supports enforcing nested ownership rules across related entities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| absoluteRoles         | A list of role names that grant unconditional access to this API in terms of authentication and authorization. Users with any of these roles will bypass all auth checks—including role, permission, ownership, and membership and custom 401-403 validations. However, business-level validations (e.g., required fields, value constraints) will still apply to ensure domain correctness.                                |
| checkRoles            | A list of roles that are required to pass basic role checks for this API. These are not absolute—users with these roles still undergo other validations and access control checks unless also included in `absoluteRoles`. Multiple roles are combined using OR logic.                                                                                                                                                      |
| defaultPermissions    | Defines a list of required permissions that the user must have globally or through roles/groups. For `get`, `update`, and `delete` APIs, object-level overrides may also be considered if the main data object supports object permissions. Multiple permissions are combined using AND logic. For complex, conditional, or cross-object permissions, use `PermissionCheckAction` or `ObjectPermissionCheckAction` instead. |

#### BusinessApiParameter

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines a customizable input parameter for a Business API. Parameters are extracted from the incoming request, transformed and validated, and then written directly to the API context under `this.<name>`. These parameters may originate from any request part (e.g., body, query, session), and can be combined with Redis-based or auto-generated parameters.

```typescript
interface BusinessApiParameter = {
  name : String;
  type : DataTypes;
  required : Boolean;
  defaultValue : AnyComplex;
  httpLocation : RequestLocations;
  dataPath : String;
  transform : MScript;
  hidden : Boolean;
  description : Text;
}
```

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name         | The name of the parameter in the API context. The value will be available at `this.<name>` during Business API execution. This does not need to match the incoming request key.                                                                                     |
| type         | The expected data type of the parameter, selected from the standard `DataTypes` enum (e.g., String, Number, Boolean). Used for validation and casting.                                                                                                              |
| required     | Indicates whether the parameter must be present in the incoming request. If true and the parameter is missing, the API will return a validation error.                                                                                                              |
| defaultValue | Optional fallback value to use when the parameter is not present. If provided, it allows the parameter to be optional without causing validation errors.                                                                                                            |
| httpLocation | The section of the HTTP request to extract the parameter from (e.g., `body`, `query`, `session`). Chosen from the `RequestLocations` enum.                                                                                                                          |

| description  | Human-readable explanation of the parameter’s purpose. For auto-generated parameters, this inherits the description from the linked data object property. For manually defined parameters, the developer should provide one.                                        |

#### RedisApiParameter

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines a parameter whose value is fetched from Redis before Business API execution begins. The result is written directly to the context as `this.<name>`, making it accessible like any other parameter. This is useful for injecting server-side or cached state without requiring the client to send it explicitly.

```typescript
interface RedisApiParameter = {
  name : String;
  type : DataTypes;
  required : Boolean;
  defaultValue : AnyComplex;
  redisKey : String;
}
```

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name         | The name under which the Redis value will be stored in the context. For example, setting this to `tenantConfig` makes it accessible as `this.tenantConfig`. |
| type         | The expected data type for the Redis value (e.g., String, Boolean, Object). Used for validation and type enforcement.                                       |
| required     | If true, the API will throw an error if the Redis key is missing or the value is null. If false, the value is optional and `defaultValue` may apply.        |
| defaultValue | Optional fallback value if the Redis lookup fails. Use this to allow Redis parameters to be optional in logic flow.                                         |
| redisKey     | An MScript expression that evaluates to the Redis key from which to read the value. This can include dynamic tokens like `this.session.userId`.             |

| joinedDataObject | The name of the data object to be joined. Note that this object should be defined as a related object in the relation settings of one of the main object properties. Or the joined object should have got a relation defined in one of its properties. If the relation is to the main object form another object, the join result will be an array for an object list. The relation may be either in the same service or in a remote service. Mindbricks will arrange the code to make the join either through db or the elastic search index.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| selector         | The selector to find the property relation if there is more than one relation. A relation selector is a special string with a map syntax foreignKey->localKey. Leave null to select the first in case you are sure there is only one realtion with the target data object. Eg. Main object is user, joined object is project, id->ownerId (user projects). Main object is project and joined object is user, ownerId->id (project owner). Relation selector has got optional syntaxes. -> or empty (the first relation to the user object, use if there is only one). ->lastUpdateUserId (the first relation to joined object's lastUserId or from it.), Main object is project and joined object is user, ownerId-> (the first relation made from ownerId property to the joined object. project owner ).

| topPick          | A number to limit the number of objects in array result fecthed in case the tarrget has a parental relation with the main object. Leave it null for one to one joins where only one or no object will be fetched. If top pick is 1, the result will be a single object even though teh fetch is an array. Example usage, to get the older member of a club in a getClub api, the member join will be sorted by -age desc- and topPick will be 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

#### SortByItem

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Sort clause configuration for list operations.

```typescript
interface SortByItem = {
  property : PropRefer;
  order : SortOrder;
  name : String;
}
```

| Field    | Description                                                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| property | A property reference to define the field that the sort will be done by. |
| order    | The sort order, it should be either asc or desc                         |
| name     | A human readable code safe name to define the sort item                 |

#### SortOrder

Defines sorting direction — ascending (asc) or descending (desc).

```js
SortOrderNames = ["asc", "desc"];

const SortOrder = {
  asc: 0,
  desc: 1,
};
```

| Enum | Description                |
| ---- | -------------------------- |
| asc  | Ascending order (default). |
| desc | Descending order.          |

#### DataClauseSettings

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines additional data values to be used in create or update operations. This clause augments the auto-generated data object by injecting or overriding values from context.

```typescript
interface DataClauseSettings = {
  customData : DataMapItem[];
}
```

| Field      | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| customData | An array of key-value assignments (MScript) to apply during create or update. These values override the corresponding properties of the main data object if defined. |

#### WhereClauseSettings

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines how records are filtered in a Business API. This includes:- `selectBy`: strict selection logic based on required field equality - `fullWhereClause`: an optional override for complex, flexible query logic - `additionalClauses`: optional conditional query fragments that are always appended to the WHERE clause, whether it is derived from `selectBy` or `fullWhereClause`. Use `selectBy` when your selection logic is static and business-critical (e.g., `['id']`). Use `fullWhereClause` when the WHERE clause needs to be built dynamically using MScript. `additionalClauses` allow context-aware filtering such as role-based visibility or soft-delete exclusion.

```typescript
interface WhereClauseSettings = {
  selectBy : PropRefer[];
  fullWhereClause : MScript;
  additionalClauses : ExtendedClause[];
}
```

| Field             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| selectBy          | A list of fields that must be matched exactly as part of the WHERE clause. This is not a filter — it is a required selection rule. In single-record APIs (`get`, `update`, `delete`), it defines how a unique record is located. In `list` APIs, it scopes the results to only entries matching the given values. |
| fullWhereClause   | An MScript query expression that overrides all default WHERE clause logic. Use this for fully customized queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| additionalClauses | A list of conditionally applied MScript query fragments. These clauses are appended only if their conditions evaluate to true.                                                                                                                                                                                    |

#### ExtendedClause

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines an optional filtering clause that is dynamically included in the query when certain conditions are met. Enables route-level filtering to adapt to session, context, or other logic at runtime.

```typescript
interface ExtendedClause = {
  name : String;
  doWhen : MScript;
  excludeWhen : MScript;
  whereClause : MScript;
}
```

| Field       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name        | A descriptive label used for internal documentation or UI purposes. Does not impact runtime behavior.                                                                                                            |
| doWhen      | An MScript expression that determines whether the whereClause should be added to the query. If true, the clause will be applied.                                                                                 |
| excludeWhen | An MScript expression that, when false, triggers the inclusion of the whereClause. Acts as an inverse condition to doWhen.                                                                                       |
| whereClause | The conditional query fragment to include, written as an MScript Query. This clause is merged into the final query if doWhen is true or excludeWhen is false. If both are omitted, the clause is always applied. |

#### DeleteOptions

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines behavior for delete-type Business APIs, including soft deletion logic.

```typescript
interface DeleteOptions = {
  useSoftDelete : Boolean;
}
```

| Field         | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| useSoftDelete | If true, the record will be marked as deleted instead of removed. The implementation depends on the data object’s soft delete configuration. |

#### GetOptions

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Options specific to `get`-type Business APIs for customizing how a single record is fetched.

```typescript
interface GetOptions = {
  setAsRead : DataMapItem[];
}
```

| Field     | Description                                                                                                                          |

```typescript
interface ListSearchFilter = {
  hasSearchFilter : Boolean;
  condition : MScript;
  keyword : MScript;
  searchProperties : PropRefer[];
}
```

Or the joined object should have got a relation defined in one of its properties. The relation may be either in the same service or in a remote service. Mindbricks will arrange the code to make the join either through db or the elastic search index.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| selector         | The selector to find the property relation if there is more than one relation. A relation selector is a special string with a map syntax foreignKey->localKey. Leave null to select the first in case you are sure there is only one relation with the target data object. Eg. Main object is user, joined object is project, id->ownerId (user projects). Main object is project and joined object is user, ownerId->id (project owner). Relation selector has got optional syntaxes. -> or empty (the first relation to the user object, use if there is only one). ->lastUpdateUserId (the first relation to joined object's lastUserId or from it.), Main object is project and joined object is user, ownerId-> (the first relation made from ownerId property to the joined object. project owner ). But for readability it is best to use the complete syntax. |

#### InterserviceCallAction

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Calls another Business API defined in a different microservice. This enables inter-service coordination within a Mindbricks-powered system. The response can be extracted into the context or added to the API response. This action supports dynamic parameters and flexible response handling.

```typescript
interface InterserviceCallAction extends BusinessApiAction = {
  targetService : String;
  targetApi : String;
  apiParameters : DataMapItem[];
  responseProperty : String;
  isArray : Boolean;
}
```

| Field            | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| targetService    | The logical name of the microservice where the target Business API is defined.                                                                   |
| targetApi        | The name of the target Business API to call in the foreign service.                                                                              |
| apiParameters    | A list of key-value MScript expressions passed as input parameters to the target API. These are dynamically evaluated using the current context. |
| responseProperty | If defined, only the specified property will be extracted from the target API response. Otherwise, the full response object is stored.           |
| isArray          | If true, the result is expected to be an array. This influences how the response is processed and stored.                                        |

#### CreateCrudAction

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines an embedded creation operation for a related data object—typically a child or associated entity—within a Business API. These actions enable transactional or cascading object creation as part of a larger business operation. Often used when the main API creates or updates a parent object and simultaneously needs to initialize dependent records (e.g., child tasks, audit logs, attachments).

```typescript
interface CreateCrudAction extends BusinessApiAction = {
  childObject : DataObjectName;
  dataClause : ApiAggregateData[];
}
```

| Field       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| childObject | Specifies the related data object to be created. This is usually a child entity or a peer linked via a foreign key to the main data object of the Business API.                                                                |
| dataClause  | An array of property-value mappings that define what data to write into the new object. Each entry uses MScript to evaluate a value from the current context. Required fields of the child object must be included explicitly. |

#### ApiAggregateData

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines a single property-value pair used to populate a related data object during an aggregated operation. This structure is used in `CreateCrudAction` and `UpdateCrudAction` to specify how each property of the child object should be assigned—either statically or dynamically—from the API execution context.

```typescript
interface ApiAggregateData = {
  dataProperty : PropRefer;
  dataValue : MScript;
}
```

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dataProperty | The name of the target property on the child object that will be set during the operation. This must match a valid property name defined in the child data object schema.                                             |
| dataValue    | The MScript expression or static value used to assign a value to the specified property. This can reference current context (`this`), a parameter (`this.input`), or loop item (`crudItem`) if executed in list mode. |

#### DeleteCrudAction

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines an embedded delete operation to remove related records—typically child or connected entities—within a Business API. This action allows declarative, conditional deletion of external data objects that are linked to the primary object. It is typically used for cascading deletes, cleanup logic, or enforcing referential integrity in business processes.

```typescript
interface DeleteCrudAction extends BusinessApiAction = {
  childObject : DataObjectName;
  whereClause : MScript;
}
```

| Field       | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| childObject | The name of the related data object from which records will be deleted. This is typically a child or logically connected entity linked to the main data object of the API.          |
| whereClause | An MScript-based query that defines the selection condition for records to be deleted. This field is required and must identify which records in the child object will be affected. |

#### UpdateCrudAction

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines an embedded update operation for related data objects—typically child or connected entities—within a Business API. This action is used when the API needs to selectively update external records based on a condition. It is commonly applied after creating or modifying a parent object to ensure consistency or to propagate business state changes across related objects.

```typescript
interface UpdateCrudAction extends BusinessApiAction = {
  childObject : DataObjectName;
  whereClause : MScript;
  dataClause : ApiAggregateData[];
}
```

| Field       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| childObject | The name of the related data object that will be updated. This object must exist in the same service or be recognized as a connected entity. Usually a child or sibling object related to the main data object of the Business API.                                       |
| whereClause | An MScript-based query that determines which records in the child object should be updated. This is a required field and must uniquely or conditionally identify the target set of records.                                                                               |
| dataClause  | A list of key-value assignments to apply to the matched records. Each item in the list defines a property of the child object and its new value (evaluated via MScript). Required fields must be included explicitly, and all values are resolved in the current context. |

#### ApiCallAction

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Calls an external or internal HTTP API during Business API execution. This is ideal for integrating with third-party services or internal utility endpoints. The fetched result is stored in context and optionally written to the response. Input and output transformation are supported.

```typescript
interface ApiCallAction extends BusinessApiAction = {
  apiCallRequest : HTTPRequest;
  isArray : Boolean;
  apiFetchProperty : String;
}
```

| Field            | Description                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| apiCallRequest   | Configuration object defining the HTTP call. Includes method, URL, headers, query parameters, and body.                                |
| isArray          | If true, the result is expected to be an array and will be treated as such during response and context processing.                     |
| apiFetchProperty | Used when the response is a complex object but only one specific property is needed. The extracted property will be stored in context. |

#### HTTPRequest

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines a reusable HTTP request configuration to interact with a remote service and retrieve a JSON response. This object is used across the platform for scenarios such as remote authentication, remote data access, and integration with external APIs (CRUD operations, searches, etc.).

```typescript
interface HTTPRequest = {
  httpRequestUrl : String;
  httpRequestMethod : HTTPRequestMethods;
  tokenLocation : RequestLocations;
  tokenName : String;
  tokenValue : String;
  httpRequestParameters : HTTPRequestParameters;
  cacheResponse : Boolean;
}
```

| Field                 | Description                                                                                                                 |

| httpRequestMethod     | The HTTP method to use when making the request. Supported methods are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.                        |
| tokenLocation         | The section of the request where the authentication token should be placed (e.g., header, cookie).                          |
| tokenName             | The name or key under which the token will be sent in the specified location.                                               |
| tokenValue            | The token value to be sent, if static. This field is optional and typically used for hardcoded tokens or fallback defaults. |
| httpRequestParameters | The parameters to send with the request, including body, query string, headers, and cookies.                                |
| cacheResponse         | Indicates whether the response of this request should be cached for reuse. Useful for minimizing repeated remote calls.     |

#### HTTPRequestMethods

An enum representing the HTTP method to use in a request.

```js
HTTPRequestMethodsNames = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE"];

const HTTPRequestMethods = {
  GET: 0,
  POST: 1,
  PUT: 2,
  PATCH: 3,
  DELETE: 4,
};
```

  httpRequestBody : DataMapItem[];
  httpRequestQuery : DataMapItem[];
  httpRequestHeaders : DataMapItem[];
  httpRequestCookies : DataMapItem[];
}
```

#### AiCallAction

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Invokes an AI model such as OpenAI or Anthropic to perform text generation, refinement, classification, or summarization. The prompt is composed from a template and context, and the result is stored in the context and optionally exposed in the response.

```typescript
interface AiCallAction extends BusinessApiAction = {
  promptTemplate : AIPromptTemplate;
  isArray : Boolean;
  aiFetchProperty : String;
  responseFormat : String;
  model : String;
}
```

| Field           | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| promptTemplate  | Defines both the static system message and dynamic user message. These are passed to the AI model to guide its behavior. Supports MScript in the user prompt. |
| isArray         | If true, the response is expected to contain a list of results. Use when the model is expected to return multiple items.                                      |
| aiFetchProperty | Optional: If the model returns a structured object and only one property is needed, specify it here to extract just that portion.                             |
| responseFormat  | Indicates the expected format of the AI's output—either `json` for structured responses or `text` for plain text.                                             |
| model           | The identifier of the LLM model to be used, such as `gpt-4`, `claude-3`, or any provider-accessible variant.                                                  |

#### AIPromptTemplate

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines the structure of an AI prompt using a two-part design: a static system-level instruction and a dynamic user message populated via MScript from the current context. Used in AiCallAction to guide AI model behavior.

```typescript
interface AIPromptTemplate = {
  systemPrompt : Text;
  userPrompt : MScript;
}
```

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| systemPrompt | A fixed instruction string that sets the tone or role for the AI model. Examples include guidance like 'You are a helpful assistant' or 'You are a strict validator'.                                                                      |
| userPrompt   | A dynamic MScript expression that generates the user-facing part of the prompt. This often references contextual variables such as `this.username`, `this.itemName`, or `this.description` to personalize or situate the model's response. |

#### MembershipCheckAction

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines access control based on membership rules configured on a data object. This is used when access to a Business API operation depends on whether the current user is a member of a related entity, such as a project, team, or organization. The `dataObjectName` field specifies which object’s membership rules should be applied—if omitted, the main data object of the Business API is used by default. This action supports direct and nested membership checks, such as validating access to a parent organization while updating a child project.

```typescript
interface MembershipCheckAction extends BusinessApiAction = {
  dataObjectName : DataObjectName;
  objectKey : MScript;
  userKey : MScript;
  checkFor : MScript;
  checkType : ApiCheckType;
  errorMessage : String;
}
```

| Field          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dataObjectName | The name of the data object whose membership configuration should be used to validate access. If omitted, the Business API’s main data object is assumed. Use this field when you need to check access against a related or parent object (e.g., checking `Organization` membership when updating a `Project`). |
| objectKey      | An MScript expression that returns the ID of the object whose membership should be checked. For example, if checking access to a project, this would return a `projectId`.                                                                                                                                      |
| userKey        | An MScript expression that returns the user ID to check against the target object’s membership configuration. Typically `this.session.userId`, but may also reference delegated users or owners.                                                                                                                |
| checkFor       | An optional MScript expression to validate specific aspects of the membership (such as role or permissions). If omitted, any valid membership grants access.                                                                                                                                                    |
| checkType      | Specifies whether this membership check should enforce access immediately (`liveCheck`) or simply write the result to context (`storedCheck`). Use `storedCheck` when the result will be used later in a conditional or validation flow.                                                                        |
| errorMessage   | A message to display when the membership check fails. Use this to provide a meaningful explanation to the user, such as 'You must be a member of this team to perform this action.'                                                                                                                             |

#### ApiCheckType

Defines how the result of a validation, permission, or membership check is used within the Business API lifecycle.

```js
ApiCheckTypeNames = ["storedCheck", "liveCheck"];

const ApiCheckType = {
  storedCheck: 0,
  liveCheck: 1,
};

| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| storedCheck | The result of the check is written to the context and does not interrupt API execution. This allows deferred decision-making or combining the result with other checks later in the workflow (e.g., in conditionals or response shaping). |
| liveCheck   | If the check fails, the Business API will immediately throw an authorization or validation error and halt execution. Use this mode when the check outcome must strictly control access or behavior.                                       |

#### PermissionCheckAction

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines a global permission check that evaluates whether the user holds specific platform or service-level permissions. This check is not tied to any particular object instance and is useful for validating roles such as `canAccessAdminPanel`, `canExportData`, or `canSendEmails`. You can either enforce the result immediately or store it in context for conditional usage later in the flow.

```typescript
interface PermissionCheckAction extends BusinessApiAction = {
  permissionName : String;
  checkType : ApiCheckType;
}
```

| Field          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| permissionName | The name of the permission that the user must possess. The check will only succeed if the user has the given permission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| checkType      | Specifies how the result of the check should be handled. When set to `liveCheck`, the Business API will immediately throw an authorization error if the check fails, halting execution. When set to `storedCheck`, the result is stored in context and does not interrupt execution—even if the check fails. This allows for advanced, combinational authorization logic where multiple checks may be evaluated together later in the workflow. |

#### ObjectPermissionCheckAction

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Performs a permission check scoped to a specific object instance. It evaluates whether the current user has the required permissions on the resolved object, based on all applicable sources: directly assigned object permissions, inherited permissions from parent contexts (e.g., user or role permissions), and dynamic ABAC rules that intersect with the object’s attributes. This check is used when fine-grained, instance-level authorization is required.

```typescript
interface ObjectPermissionCheckAction extends BusinessApiAction = {
  permissionName : String[];
  readObjectIdFrom : MScript;
  checkType : ApiCheckType;
}
```

| Field            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| permissionName   | The name of the permission that the user must possess on the resolved object instance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| readObjectIdFrom | An MScript expression that evaluates to the ID of the specific instance whose permissions should be checked. This could reference input parameters, session values, or context-fetched records (e.g., `this.projectId` or `this.parent.organizationId`).                                                               |
| checkType        | Specifies how the result of the check is handled. If set to `liveCheck`, the API will immediately throw a permission error if the check fails. If set to `storedCheck`, the result is stored in the context and does not interrupt execution—allowing you to combine multiple permission checks later in the workflow. |

#### ReadJwtTokenAction

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines a read jwt token operation from either context, session or request and write its payload to the context with the contextPropertyName after validating it. The token signature should be in HMAC format. The token payload may be used for allowing access to an object via a signed token instead of standard authentication. This is typically used for public or limited-access sharing workflows (e.g., view-only links). Once the token payload is in context any other validations may be performed using the payload values in further actions.

```typescript
interface ReadJwtTokenAction extends BusinessApiAction = {
  readTokenFrom : MScript;
  jwtKey : MScript;
  isRequired : Boolean;
  statusCheck : MScript;
}
```

| Field         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| readTokenFrom | An MScript value that evaluates to the decoded value of token. It may be in the context through parameters like `this.accessToken`, it may be read directly from controller request like `this.request.query.payToken` or it may be read from the session in cases where users have their own tokens for authorization like this.session.userSubscrition.        |
| jwtKey        | An MScript value that evaluates to the Jwt key to validate the token signature. It may be an hardcoded value like `1234560987abcdef` or a reference to context like this.jwtKey or a env reference like process.env.SUBS_KEY.                                                                                                                                    |
| isRequired    | A Boolean value to define if the token is required. Set it true if you want the application throw an error if the token is null or can not be validated.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| statusCheck   | If you want to check the payload across some specific requirements use this check script. If the check is not validated the token will be considered invalid. You can also use this script if you will use token for only single business logic validation, if you need the validation in many steps then dont use this script other than general status checks. |

#### ValidationAction

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines a flexible business rule that performs a dynamic condition check during Business API execution. Unlike permission or membership checks, a ValidationAction is fully script-based and domain-specific, allowing complex logical conditions such as subscription status, object states, quota limits, feature flags, or compliance rules. If the validation fails, the system either throws an error (liveCheck) or stores the result in context for later decision-making (storedCheck).

```typescript
interface ValidationAction extends BusinessApiAction = {
  description : Text;
  shouldBeTrue : Boolean;
  checkType : ApiCheckType;
  validationScript : MScript;
  errorMessage : String;
  errorStatus : ErrorStatus;
}
```

| Field            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| description      | A short, human-readable description explaining the intent of the validation—such as 'User must be active subscriber', 'Quota must not be exceeded', or 'Document must be in draft state'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| shouldBeTrue     | Indicates the expected outcome of the validation logic. If `true`, the validation passes when the condition evaluates to `true`. Set to `false` when the validation should pass on a `false` condition (e.g., `!isUserBanned`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| checkType        | Specifies how the result of the validation is handled. If `liveCheck`, the API throws an error immediately when the validation fails. If `storedCheck`, the result is saved to context and execution continues—allowing deferred or compound logic.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| validationScript | An MScript expression that returns a boolean value based on current API context. This defines the actual validation condition. If the result does not match `shouldBeTrue`, the validation fails.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| errorMessage     | Message returned to the client if the validation fails and `checkType` is `liveCheck`. This should be clear and relevant to the context, e.g., 'Your plan does not allow creating more projects.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| errorStatus      | The HTTP status code to return when the validation fails and `checkType` is set to `liveCheck`. If the status code is `401` (Unauthorized) or `403` (Forbidden), Mindbricks treats the failure as an authorization error—which is automatically bypassed for users with absolute roles assigned to the current API (e.g., `superAdmin`). Use `400` (Bad Request) for business rule violations that should apply to all users regardless of role. |

#### ErrorStatus

Mindbricks error status codes represent standardized HTTP-style error responses used across all controller types. These codes provide consistent semantic feedback for route errors, especially in REST APIs.

```js
ErrorStatusNames = ["400", "401", "403", "404", "500"];

const ErrorStatus = {
  400: 0,
  401: 1,
  403: 2,
  404: 3,
  500: 4,
};
```

| Enum | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400  | BadRequestError — Returned when request parameters are invalid, malformed, or missing required data.                                     |
| 401  | NotAuthenticatedError — Returned when no valid user session is found. Typically indicates a login is required.                           |
| 403  | ForbiddenError — Returned when the user is authenticated but does not have sufficient permissions or rights for the requested operation. |
| 404  | NotFoundError — Returned when a required resource or data entry is not found in the system, such as a missing record or object.          |
| 500  | HttpSystemError — Returned for internal server or system-level errors, such as database failures or unexpected exceptions.               |

#### AddToContextAction

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Adds one or more calculated values to the runtime context (`this`) at a specific point in the Business API flow. This is typically used to prepare values that will be referenced in later actions, such as computed totals, enriched properties, or temporary flags. The values are evaluated via MScript and written under the names you specify.

```typescript
interface AddToContextAction extends BusinessApiAction = {
  context : ContextData[];
}
```

| Field   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| context | An array of `ContextData` objects. Each defines a property name and an MScript expression to compute its value. These values will be written to the runtime context (`this.<contextName>`), making them accessible in subsequent steps. |

#### ContextData

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

ContextData is a container object to represent any key-value pair to write or read to/from context.

```typescript
interface ContextData = {
  contextName : String;
  contextValue : MScript;
}
```

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| contextName  | The name of the variable to store in the context (e.g., `totalCost`, `userQuota`). The value will be accessible in later steps as `this.<contextName>`.                                   |
| contextValue | An MScript expression used to compute the value for this property. Can reference other context fields, parameters, session values, or constants (e.g., `this.items.length * this.price`). |

#### AddToResponseAction

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Adds one or more properties from the current context to the final response object after the main operation completes. This is useful when some values are computed or fetched indirectly (e.g., session-based, Redis-loaded, or generated) and need to be exposed in the API response explicitly.

```typescript
interface AddToResponseAction extends BusinessApiAction = {
  context : ContextData[];
}
```

| Field   | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| context | An array of `ContextData` entries. Each defines a name-value pair to be copied from the evaluated MScript into the response object. The property will appear in the final API output. |

#### RemoveFromResponseAction

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Removes one or more properties from the final API response before it is returned to the client. This is useful for eliminating internal, sensitive, or unnecessary fields that were added by earlier actions or populated from context. Commonly used to enforce privacy, avoid leaking implementation details, or to conform to specific output schemas.

```typescript
interface RemoveFromResponseAction extends BusinessApiAction = {
  properties : String[];
}
```

| Field      | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| properties | An array of property names (strings) that will be removed from the final API response. Use this to clean up sensitive or internal fields before the response is returned. |

#### RenderDataAction

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Generates a formatted string output by applying a predefined template to structured data using MScript. This is typically used to render email bodies, documents, files, or markdown/html content from API context values. The rendered result is saved into context (with contextPropertyName) and can be reused in subsequent actions such as email sending, file export, or response shaping.

```typescript
interface RenderDataAction extends BusinessApiAction = {
  inputData : MScript;
  template : String;

#### RefineByAiAction

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Refines or transforms a given text using an AI provider such as OpenAI or Anthropic. The action supports adjustable refinement depth via temperature and mode, and allows instruction control through a system prompt. The result is stored in the context and can be reused in rendering, messaging, or responses. Use this for rephrasing, summarizing, tone-shifting, or grammar correction.

```typescript
interface RefineByAiAction extends BusinessApiAction = {
  provider : String;
  inputData : MScript;
  systemPrompt : String;
  temperature : Double;
  mode : String;
}
```

  start: 1,
  complete: 2,
  refresh: 3,
  callback: 4,
};
```

| Enum     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| simple   | The lifecycle is simple it is just one sync call to handle everything, creating the charge immedeatly.                                                                                                       |
| start    | The payment operation is wanted to be started, mostly an intent is created on the frontend side, but also it can be started in the server side.                                                              |

| refresh  | The payment operation data in the gateway server will be fetched and the application payment tickets and order status will be refreshed according to the server. Use this if you dont want to use a webhook. |
| callback | The api is called by the gateway webhook, so the refresh operation will be held asyncronously. Use this option if you provide your api as a webhook to the provider.                                         |

#### VerifyWebhookAction

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Verifies a webhook call of a provider with its signature secret and reads the parameeters and writes them to the context.

```typescript
interface VerifyWebhookAction extends BusinessApiAction = {
  provider : String;
  secretKey : MScript;
}
```

| Field     | Description                                                                                                           |

#### IntegrationAction

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Calls a native API integration provided by Mindbricks (e.g., AWS S3, Airtable, Stripe, Asana). Each integration exposes a set of predefined actions, and this object triggers one of them with dynamically computed parameters. The result is stored in the context and can be used in follow-up steps. This allows low-code access to third-party systems using structured inputs.

```typescript
interface IntegrationAction extends BusinessApiAction = {
  provider : IntegrationProvider;
  action : String;
  parameters : IntegrationParameter[];
}
```

| Field      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| provider   | The identifier of the external service provider to call (e.g., `aws`, `asana`, `salesforce`). Must match a supported integration configured within Mindbricks.                                                  |
| action     | The specific action or operation to invoke on the provider. For example: `uploadFile`, `createRecord`, `deleteObject`, `listItems`. Action names must match those exposed by the selected integration provider. |
| parameters | An array of parameter objects that define the inputs to pass to the integration action. Each parameter includes a name and a dynamically evaluated value from context.                                          |

#### IntegrationParameter

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines a single named input to be passed to a native integration provider action. Parameter values are evaluated using MScript and can be derived from session, context, or external input.

```typescript
interface IntegrationParameter = {
  parameterName : String;
  parameterValue : MScript;
}
```

| Field          | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| parameterName  | The name of the parameter as expected by the integration action (e.g., `bucketName`, `filePath`, `email`).                                                |
| parameterValue | An MScript expression that resolves to the parameter value. This can reference current context, session variables, request parameters, or computed logic. |

#### LoopAction

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines a repeated execution block within a Business API workflow. It loops over the result of an MScript expression and executes a list of actions for each item. The current item is exposed as a local variable named by `loopItemName`, directly accessible in MScript. Loop actions can be nested to support multi-level iteration, enabling hierarchical or grid-like data processing patterns.

```typescript
interface LoopAction extends BusinessApiAction = {
  loopFor : MScript;
  loopItemName : String;
  isParallel : Boolean;
  actions : String[];
}
```

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| loopFor      | An MScript expression that evaluates to an iterable (such as an array). Each element of the result will be bound to the variable defined by `loopItemName` and processed through the listed actions.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| loopItemName | The name of the variable representing the current item in each loop iteration. This variable is directly accessible in MScript without `this.`. For example, if `loopItemName` is `customerItem`, you can reference `customerItem.id` or `customerItem.status` inside any action executed in the loop.                                                                                     |
| isParallel   | A boolean value to control the non-blockin behaviour of the loop steps. If isParallel set to true, all loop steps will be called as async together, but the loop itself will be awaited. If it is false, all steps are awaited and executed one by one. Use the async option if you are sure that the target source (like db, redis, cpu, disk) will be able manage multiple jobs at once. |
| actions      | An array of action names (as strings) to execute during each loop iteration. These actions must be previously defined in the Business API's action store.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

#### ParallelAction

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines a non-blocking execution group in which multiple actions are executed in parallel. Each action runs independently using the same input context. Parallel actions are useful for concurrent fetches, validations, or other side-effect-free logic. This action can also include nested `ParallelAction` or `LoopAction` steps, enabling concurrent or branched execution across multiple layers of the workflow.

```typescript
interface ParallelAction extends BusinessApiAction = {
  actions : String[];
}
```

| Field   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| actions | An array of action names (as strings) to be executed concurrently. Each action in this list will run using the shared context. Nested parallel and loop actions are supported for composing deeply concurrent workflows. |

#### BusinessWorkflow

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines the execution flow milestones of a Business API. Only one of the sub-flows (create, update, delete, get, list) will be populated, based on the `crudType` of the API. Each workflow contains ordered arrays of action ids to be executed at predefined lifecycle milestones (e.g., after reading parameters, after the main DB operation). These workflows allow complete control of the API's logic and are fully compatible with visual workflow editors.

```typescript
interface BusinessWorkflow = {
  create : CreateBusinessWorkflow;
  update : UpdateBusinessWorkflow;
  delete : DeleteBusinessWorkflow;
  get : GetBusinessWorkflow;
  list : ListBusinessWorkflow;
}
```

| Field  | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| create | The milestone execution flow for a `create`-type API. Contains action arrays tied to standard lifecycle stages of record creation.                               |
| update | The milestone execution flow for an `update`-type API. Contains action arrays tied to record lookup, validation, mutation, and response shaping.                 |
| delete | The milestone execution flow for a `delete`-type API. Contains action arrays for lookup, conditional deletion, side-effects, and cleanup.                        |
| get    | The milestone execution flow for a `get`-type API. Contains actions that run at fixed read-only stages like parameter validation, access checks, and enrichment. |
| list   | The milestone execution flow for a `list`-type API. Enables filtering, paging, sorting, and post-query actions such as formatting or permission-based shaping.   |

#### CreateBusinessWorkflow

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines the standard execution milestones for a `create`-type Business API. Each field represents a milestone (a fixed lifecycle stage), and its value is an ordered list of action ids executed by the API manager. These steps include all default, hardcoded logic (e.g., session handling, parameter extraction, DB insert) while leaving space for user-defined actions after each milestone. You can modify this workflow programmatically or visually.

```typescript
interface CreateBusinessWorkflow = {
  afterStartBusinessApi : String[];
  afterReadParameters : String[];
  afterTransposeParameters : String[];
  afterCheckParameters : String[];
  afterCheckBasicAuth : String[];
  afterBuildDataClause : String[];
  afterMainCreateOperation : String[];
  afterBuildOutput : String[];
  afterSendResponse : String[];
  afterApiEvent : String[];
}
```

| Field                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| afterStartBusinessApi    | Executed before everything just after the api is started by the controller. Context has just got the raw request object and the session object populated by the controller. Use this stage for fundemantal validations or to manüpulate the context before everything. |
| afterReadParameters      | Triggered after all parameters are read from the request or Redis. Use this to perform early validation or context enrichment based on raw input.                                                                                                                      |
| afterTransposeParameters | Executed after parameters are normalized or transformed. Use this for logic that depends on preprocessed values (e.g., derived inputs or structure remapping).                                                                                                         |
| afterCheckParameters     | Runs after parameter validations complete. Use this for business logic checks or to raise field-specific errors (e.g., pricing thresholds, invalid combinations).                                                                                                      |
| afterCheckBasicAuth      | Fires after role and permission validations. Typically used to enforce fine-grained access checks or audit preparation logic.                                                                                                                                          |
| afterBuildDataClause     | Executed after the data clause object is constructed and before the actual create operation. Use this to inject additional fields or adjust payload structure.                                                                                                         |
| afterMainCreateOperation | Runs immediately after the database insert operation completes. Ideal for events, side-effects, or chained actions based on the created record.                                                                                                                        |
| afterBuildOutput         | Allows final shaping of the response payload before it is sent. You can inject, modify, or strip fields at this stage.                                                                                                                                                 |
| afterSendResponse        | Triggered after the response is sent to the client. Use for post-response operations like analytics, logging, or delayed workflows.                                                                                                                                    |
| afterApiEvent            | Triggered after the Business API emits an API-level event (if configured). This is the final milestone in the API execution flow and is typically used for cleanup, async queues, or chained notifications that depend on event dispatch success.                      |

#### UpdateBusinessWorkflow

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines the execution milestones for an `update`-type Business API, used to modify an existing record. Each field represents a fixed lifecycle milestone. Custom action ids placed under a milestone will be executed in order after that point. These workflows enable full customization of business logic without overriding default update behavior, and they support visual modeling of logic steps.

```typescript
interface UpdateBusinessWorkflow = {
  afterStartBusinessApi : String[];
  afterReadParameters : String[];
  afterTransposeParameters : String[];
  afterCheckParameters : String[];

| Field                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| afterStartBusinessApi    | Executed before everything just after the api is started by the controller. Context has just got the raw request object and the session object populated by the controller. Use this stage for fundemantal validations or to manüpulate the context before everything. |
| afterReadParameters      | Triggered after all parameters are read from the request or Redis. Use this to perform early validation or context enrichment based on raw input.                                                                                                                      |
| afterTransposeParameters | Executed after parameters are normalized or transformed. Use this for logic that depends on preprocessed values (e.g., derived inputs or structure remapping).                                                                                                         |
| afterCheckParameters     | Runs after parameter validations complete. Use this for business logic checks or to raise field-specific errors (e.g., pricing thresholds, invalid combinations).                                                                                                      |
| afterCheckBasicAuth      | Fires after role and permission validations. Typically used to enforce fine-grained access checks or audit preparation logic.                                                                                                                                          |
| afterBuildWhereClause    | Occurs once the main `WHERE` clause is generated for the query. Insert actions here to log or modify query conditions or add scoped audit logic. This where clause will be first used to fetch the instance to be updated.                                             |
| afterFetchInstance       | Fires after manager fetches the target record before it is updated and written to the context for pre-operation checks. Insert your own actions here to add your own checks or to mnanipulate default instance check which will be executed next.                      |
| afterCheckInstance       | Triggered after the instance is dispatched and check for basic requirements like existence or ownership. Insert actions here to make your own checks on the instance that will be updated.                                                                             |
| afterBuildDataClause     | Executed after the update data clause object is constructed and before the actual update operation. Use this to inject additional fields or adjust payload structure.                                                                                                  |
| afterMainUpdateOperation | Runs immediately after the database update operation completes. Ideal for events, side-effects, or chained actions based on the updated record.                                                                                                                        |
| afterBuildOutput         | Allows final shaping of the response payload before it is sent. You can inject, modify, or strip fields at this stage.                                                                                                                                                 |
| afterSendResponse        | Triggered after the response is sent to the client. Use for post-response operations like analytics, logging, or delayed workflows.                                                                                                                                    |
| afterApiEvent            | Triggered after the Business API emits an API-level event (if configured). This is the final milestone in the API execution flow and is typically used for cleanup, async queues, or chained notifications that depend on event dispatch success.                      |

#### DeleteBusinessWorkflow

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines the execution milestones for a `delete`-type Business API, which removes or soft-deletes a single record. Each field corresponds to a lifecycle milestone. Custom actions inserted at any milestone are executed in order after that point. This enables fine-grained control over logic such as confirmation checks, permission gating, logging, or external integrations—without needing to override the default deletion behavior.

```typescript
interface DeleteBusinessWorkflow = {
  afterStartBusinessApi : String[];
  afterReadParameters : String[];
  afterTransposeParameters : String[];
  afterCheckParameters : String[];
  afterCheckBasicAuth : String[];
  afterBuildWhereClause : String[];
  afterFetchInstance : String[];
  afterCheckInstance : String[];
  afterMainDeleteOperation : String[];
  afterBuildOutput : String[];
  afterSendResponse : String[];
  afterApiEvent : String[];
}
```

#### GetBusinessWorkflow

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines the execution milestones for a `get`-type Business API, which retrieves a single record. Each milestone represents a predefined point in the API lifecycle. Action ids listed under a milestone will be executed in the given order immediately after that point is reached. This structure enables customized behaviors like access control, derived property enrichment, or API shaping without overriding core logic.

```typescript
interface GetBusinessWorkflow = {
  afterStartBusinessApi : String[];
  afterReadParameters : String[];
  afterTransposeParameters : String[];
  afterCheckParameters : String[];
  afterCheckBasicAuth : String[];
  afterBuildWhereClause : String[];
  afterMainGetOperation : String[];
  afterCheckInstance : String[];
  afterBuildOutput : String[];
  afterSendResponse : String[];
  afterApiEvent : String[];
}
```

| Field                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| afterStartBusinessApi    | Executed before everything just after the api is started by the controller. Context has just got the raw request object and the session object populated by the controller. Use this stage for fundemantal validations or to manüpulate the context before everything. |
| afterReadParameters      | Executed after parameters are extracted from the request. This is the earliest milestone and is ideal for initial validation, normalization, or preprocessing.                                                                                                         |
| afterTransposeParameters | Runs after parameter transformation, such as type coercion or merging Redis parameters. Use this stage to derive dependent values or reformat inputs.                                                                                                                  |
| afterCheckParameters     | Triggered after core validations on required or custom parameters complete. Insert validation actions here to enforce business-specific input rules.                                                                                                                   |
| afterCheckBasicAuth      | Executed after basic role and permission checks are performed. Use this for object-level access guards or dynamic access logic based on user roles.                                                                                                                    |
| afterBuildWhereClause    | Occurs once the main `WHERE` clause is generated for the query. Insert actions here to log or modify fetch conditions or add scoped audit logic.                                                                                                                       |
| afterMainGetOperation    | Runs immediately after the object is fetched from the database. This is the best point for enrichment actions like fetching related data or computing derived properties.                                                                                              |
| afterCheckInstance       | Triggered after the response is dispatched. Use for non-blocking post-response actions like logging, analytics, or starting asynchronous flows.                                                                                                                        |
| afterBuildOutput         | Executes after the response payload is constructed but before it is sent. Use this to adjust formatting, inject extra context, or remove sensitive fields.                                                                                                             |
| afterSendResponse        | Triggered after the response is dispatched. Use for non-blocking post-response actions like logging, analytics, or starting asynchronous flows.                                                                                                                        |
| afterApiEvent            | Runs after the optional API-level event has been emitted. This is the final milestone and is ideal for actions that should occur after the workflow is complete.                                                                                                       |

#### ListBusinessWorkflow

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines the execution milestones for a `list`-type Business API, which returns a paginated set of records. Each field represents a fixed lifecycle milestone. Action ids added to a milestone will be executed in order after that point. This structure enables modular extension of logic for filtering, permission enforcement, data enrichment, and more—without overriding the main query behavior.

```typescript
interface ListBusinessWorkflow = {
  afterStartBusinessApi : String[];
  afterReadParameters : String[];
  afterTransposeParameters : String[];
  afterCheckParameters : String[];
  afterCheckBasicAuth : String[];
  afterBuildWhereClause : String[];
  afterMainListOperation : String[];
  afterBuildOutput : String[];
  afterSendResponse : String[];
  afterApiEvent : String[];
}
```

| Field                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| afterStartBusinessApi    | Executed before everything just after the api is started by the controller. Context has just got the raw request object and the session object populated by the controller. Use this stage for fundemantal validations or to manüpulate the context before everything. |
| afterReadParameters      | Executed immediately after request and Redis parameters are read into context. Use this stage for early validations or transformations on raw inputs.                                                                                                                  |
| afterTransposeParameters | Runs after parameter reshaping or normalization logic. Use this for refining structured inputs or deriving helper values for downstream use.                                                                                                                           |
| afterCheckParameters     | Executed after required and custom parameters have been validated. Place custom validation or cross-field logic actions here.                                                                                                                                          |
| afterCheckBasicAuth      | Runs after role-based access checks. Use this milestone to insert actions that enforce access based on session, membership, or other dynamic conditions.                                                                                                               |
| afterBuildWhereClause    | Triggered after the main query’s `WHERE` clause has been finalized. Insert logic here for audit logging or external query construction monitoring.                                                                                                                     |
| afterMainListOperation   | Runs after the paginated list has been retrieved from the database. Use this milestone for data enrichment, parallel fetches, or computed fields.                                                                                                                      |
| afterBuildOutput         | Executed after the response payload has been shaped. This is the best point to inject additional context, sanitize outputs, or apply output transformations.                                                                                                           |
| afterSendResponse        | Runs after the list result has been sent to the client. Use this for analytics, usage tracking, or triggering asynchronous actions.                                                                                                                                    |
| afterApiEvent            | Executed after the optional API-level event is published (if configured). This is the final milestone for clean-up or system-level broadcasting.                                                                                                                       |

### ServiceLibrary

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines a custom service library for your Mindbricks service. A ServiceLibrary is a modular container for user-defined code, templates, and assets. It allows developers to inject business-specific logic or reusable components into the service. You can define functions, templates, and assets, as well as edge functions (used by edge controllers to fully control the route lifecycle). These modules can be referenced throughout the service—for example, in validations, permissions, conditions, or hooks.

```typescript
interface ServiceLibrary = {
  functions : LibModule[];
  edgeFunctions : LibModule[];
  templates : LibModule[];
  assets : LibModule[];
  public : LibModule[];
}
```

| Field         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| functions     | List of reusable JavaScript functions available in the service. These are general-purpose functions used in validations, permissions, and other scripts. Each function is defined as a `LibModule`, exporting a callable function or a structured object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| edgeFunctions | Functions invoked by edge controllers, enabling fully custom handling of requests. These modules must export an async function that accepts a single request parameter and returns an API response or throws an error. Standard validations will still apply before execution. A sample helloWorld edge function would be like following: `{ 'moduleName': 'helloWorld', 'moduleExtension': 'js', 'moduleBody': 'module.exports = async (request) => { return { status: 200, message: \"Hello from the edge function\", date: new Date().toISOString() }; }' }`. |
| templates     | Templates used within the service to render dynamic content such as emails, documents, or downloads. Typically written in `ejs`, they are evaluated with route data before rendering the final output.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| assets        | Static text or image-based files (e.g., credentials, configs, illustrations) used by the business logic. These can be used internally or for generating downloadable content. Each is defined as a `LibModule`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| public        | Public files exposed via a static URL, accessible directly by frontend or client-side apps. Used for assets like logos, PDFs, or other client-facing files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

#### LibModule

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines a module file in the service library. This object is used for declaring code, templates, or file assets that enhance your business logic. A `LibModule` can be a JavaScript function, an HTML template, or a static text/image file. JavaScript modules should export functions or objects conforming to their assigned context, such as validations, edge functions.

```typescript
interface LibModule = {
  moduleName : String;
  moduleExtension : String;
  moduleBody : Text;
}
```

| Field           | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| moduleName      | The name of the module. Should be unique within the library. Use lowercase or camelCase (e.g., `updateParent`). This name is used to reference the function or file in route logic. |
| moduleExtension | The file extension of the module, such as `js`, `json`, `ejs`, `txt`, `svg`, or `pdf`. This defines how Mindbricks interprets or stores the content.                                |
| moduleBody      | The content of the module. This may be JavaScript code, template HTML, or any other textual asset depending on its extension.                                                       |

### EdgeController

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

An edge controller defines a fully customized route handled by a developer-defined function. Unlike standard Busines APIs, it gives full control over the request processing by directly calling a function from the service library. This allows advanced operations like database queries, external API calls, or dynamic responses without following the CRUD cycle. Edge controllers are ideal for building special-purpose APIs or custom flows outside Mindbricks' automatic route generation.

```typescript
interface EdgeController = {
  edgeControllerOptions : EdgeControllerOptions;
  edgeRestSettings : EdgeRestSettings;
}
```

| Field                 | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| edgeControllerOptions | Configuration object for the edge controller. It defines which edge function will be executed and whether login is required to access it.            |
| edgeRestSettings      | HTTP settings for exposing the edge controller as a REST API. It allows specifying the URL path and HTTP method that will trigger the edge function. |

#### EdgeControllerOptions

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Options that define the execution behavior of the edge controller, including the function to call and login requirement.

```typescript
interface EdgeControllerOptions = {
  functionName : String;
  loginRequired : Boolean;
}
```

| Field         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| functionName  | The name of the function defined in the service library that will handle this controller’s logic. The function must be an async module under 'edgeFunctions' and should return an object or throw an error as response. |
| loginRequired | Whether the caller must be logged in to access this edge route. If true, Mindbricks will enforce authentication using session or token checks before invoking the function.                                             |

#### EdgeRestSettings

**MPO Version:** 1.3.0

Defines the public REST endpoint for the edge controller. Specifies how the route is exposed via HTTP, including path and method.

```typescript
interface EdgeRestSettings = {
  path : String;
  method : HTTPRequestMethods;
}
```

| Field  | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| path   | The relative URL path for this controller. It determines where the edge function will be accessible in the REST API (e.g., '/generate-invoice'). |
| method | The HTTP method that will trigger the edge controller. Typical values include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.                                       |
