title: Track Your Metrics
description: >-
  Monitor real-time resource usage and service health across preview, staging,
  and production environments to ensure system stability and performance.

## **Observability & Metrics**

The Observability page provides runtime visibility into **all running services**, including:

- **Preview environments** – temporary 30-minute preview sessions created during API testing

- **Stage environments** – deployed services used for validation and integration

- **Production environments** – live services serving real users

Preview metrics appear only while a preview session is active, whereas
stage and production metrics remain available as long as the server is active and the services are running.

## **What Observability Shows**

The Observability page displays **container-level metrics** for each environment:

- **Preview environment**

- **Stage environment**

- **Production environment**

Each deployed service runs inside its own container, and metrics are shown **per service**, not aggregated.

---

## **Container Resource Metrics**

For every running service container, you can see:

### **CPU Usage**

- Shows the current CPU consumption percentage

- Helps identify:

  - CPU-heavy services

  - Inefficient logic

  - Unexpected processing spikes

### **Memory Usage**

- Displays memory consumption as a percentage

- Useful for detecting:

  - Memory leaks

  - Under-provisioned services

  - Sudden memory growth after deployments

### **Runtime Status**

Each container clearly shows its current state:

- **Running**

- **Pending**

- **Failed**

You can immediately tell which services are healthy and which may need attention.

### **Uptime info**

Each service container displays uptime information.

Uptime shows:

- How long the service has been running continuously

- Whether the container was recently restarted

- Stability of the service after deployment

Uptime helps you:

- Verify successful deployments

- Detect unexpected restarts or crashes

- Understand service longevity in Stage and Production environments

For preview environments, uptime reflects the short-lived preview session.
For stage and production, uptime persists as long as the service remains deployed and running.

---

## **Environment Separation**

Metrics are grouped by environment so you can clearly distinguish:

- **Preview metrics** – short-lived, used for testing

- **Stage metrics** – long-running validation environment

- **Production metrics** – real user traffic and live workloads

This separation helps you:

- Validate performance in Stage before Production

- Compare resource usage across environments

- Debug issues without affecting live users

---

## **Service-Level Visibility**

Each card represents a **single microservice container**, such as:

- `auth`

- `bff`

- `notification`

- `panel`

- domain-specific services (e.g. `company`, `messaging`, `content`)

This makes it easy to:

- Identify which service is consuming the most resources

- Correlate performance issues to a specific service

- Scale or optimize only the affected parts of the system

---

## **When Metrics Are Not Available**

If you see messages like:

> **No data available**
> **No metrics found for this project ID in preview/stage/prod environment.**

This usually means:

- The environment has not been deployed yet

- No containers are currently running

- The service was recently stopped or restarted

Once services are deployed and running, metrics appear automatically.

---

## **Why Observability Matters**

The Observability page allows you to:

- Monitor live system health

- Catch performance issues early

- Validate deployments after releases

- Gain confidence before scaling traffic

- Operate production systems safely

It acts as the **first line of insight** into how your application behaves in the real world.

> ℹ️ **Important Note**\
> Observability is read-only and non-intrusive.\
> It does not modify deployments or affect runtime behavior — it only gives you visibility.

For deeper debugging, logs and API testing are available through **Preview**, **Deploy History**, and service-level tools.
